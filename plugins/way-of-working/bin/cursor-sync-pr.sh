# Is there exactly one open /way-of-working:handoff cursor-sync PR that
# /way-of-working:resume may offer the human to merge -- and if there is none, is
# this checkout standing on a sync branch nobody merged?
#
# Issue #215: handoff opens the `.ai/next-steps.md` sync as its own docs-only PR and
# never merges it -- the human's merge is the approval of the cursor the next session
# may run unattended (of the `next_action` itself only through resume's display, which
# shows it beside the ledger -- WB-D20). In practice that PR was regularly forgotten, so resume
# now finds it at session start and offers the merge on one explicit confirmation.
# Deciding WHICH PR is safe to offer is a deterministic predicate, so it lives here,
# tested, rather than in skill prose -- the same shape as cursor-drift.sh and
# milestone-close-line.sh. The display, the confirmation, and the merge itself stay
# in the skill; this script never merges.
#
# Usage: cursor-sync-pr.sh <repo> <pr_base>     (run from inside the checkout)
# Prints exactly one line, to stdout, and always exits 0 (the caller decides policy):
#   none                    -- no open PR against <pr_base> whose head branch starts
#                              with `docs/sync-cursor-` (the name handoff's own step
#                              cuts), and HEAD is not on an unmerged sync branch
#   offer <N> <oid> <branch> -- exactly one such PR, passing every check below; <oid>
#                              is its head commit, which the caller must both display
#                              from and merge with `gh pr merge --match-head-commit`
#   refuse <N> <reason>     -- exactly one such PR, failing a check; <reason> is one of
#                              cross-repository | files | not-local | bypass-never |
#                              state-<mergeStateStatus, lowercased>
#   ambiguous <N> <N>...    -- more than one such PR (e.g. a forgotten earlier sync plus
#                              a newer one). Never pick one: two syncs regenerate the same
#                              file wholesale, so which is right is the human's call
#   unmerged <branch>       -- no such PR is open, but HEAD is on a `docs/sync-cursor-`
#                              branch whose tip no merged PR carries: handoff's push or
#                              PR creation failed, the human closed the PR unmerged, or
#                              it merged at a different commit (edited on GitHub, or the
#                              local branch moved on). Either way the local tip is not
#                              what was approved.
#                              Only an attached HEAD is checked: a detached HEAD reads
#                              `none`, as handoff never leaves one
#   unreadable              -- wrong arguments, not in a git checkout, a `gh` call
#                              failed, its output was not in the shape asked for, or the
#                              open-PR list hit its fetch limit (a candidate past the
#                              limit would otherwise read as `none`)
#
# The checks on a single candidate, and why each is the one it is:
#   - Same repository (`isCrossRepository` false). A fork PR is the outsider path.
#   - Changed files are exactly `.ai/next-steps.md`. Handoff keeps its PR to that one
#     file (its *Commit `.ai/next-steps.md` as its own docs-only PR* step calls that
#     load-bearing); anything wider is not a cursor sync, whatever its branch is named.
#     Park and unpark PRs share the branch prefix but also touch `.ai/parked/`, so they
#     land here too, on purpose.
#   - A LOCAL branch of the same name exists and its tip is exactly <oid> (`not-local`
#     otherwise). This is the binding that makes the offer mean something. Same-repo
#     alone is not enough on a public repo: anyone with read access can open a PR from
#     an existing branch, and a repo that keeps merged branches holds dozens of stale
#     `docs/sync-cursor-*` heads (49 beside one live sync, on this plugin's own repo
#     when this was written), and the newest of them can pass every other check. And `.ai/state.json` -- where auto-start reads
#     the `next_action` it runs -- is git-ignored and machine-local, so only a sync PR
#     THIS machine's handoff produced describes it. A sync opened from another machine
#     is refused here; the human merges that one on GitHub. The binding does not catch a
#     sync PR the human closed unmerged and an outsider reopens as a new PR while the
#     local branch survives -- the display then shows the human the same text they
#     rejected, and the merge needs the human's pinned confirmation. The PR AUTHOR is
#     deliberately not checked: `author_association` is viewer-relative, and read by a
#     `gh` account other than the PR's author it reports `CONTRIBUTOR` for the repo's
#     own maintainer (observed live on PR #210).
#   - `mergeStateStatus` is CLEAN, or BLOCKED with every PRESENT check green and no
#     blocking review (#229). Everything else -- BEHIND, DIRTY (conflicts, the usual
#     shape of a stale sync), DRAFT, UNSTABLE, UNKNOWN (GitHub still computing), and a
#     BLOCKED that fails that test -- is refused with its name, for the human.
#     Why BLOCKED is admitted at all: under a restrict-updates ruleset whose only bypass
#     actor is the repository admin role, GitHub reports BLOCKED to the admin on a PR
#     whose ONLY unmet rule is that restriction, so a CLEAN-only predicate never offers
#     anything on such a repo. But BLOCKED is also what a red or pending required check,
#     or a missing required review, looks like -- and resume's merge carries --admin,
#     which switches off gh's own client-side refusal. So this script tries to establish
#     "nothing but the restriction is unmet" itself, fail-closed: `statusCheckRollup`
#     non-empty with every entry green (CheckRun COMPLETED with SUCCESS, NEUTRAL or
#     SKIPPED; StatusContext SUCCESS -- an empty rollup is no evidence, so it is not
#     green), and `reviewDecision` neither REVIEW_REQUIRED nor CHANGES_REQUESTED. All
#     present checks, not only the required ones: stricter is the safe direction. A
#     BLOCKED PR on that evidence is offered like a CLEAN one, once the bypass check
#     below passes too.
#     Residuals, stated so the confirmation is not mistaken for more than it is:
#       - A required check that never REPORTED (a workflow `paths:` filter that excludes
#         `.ai/`, a job not yet registered) is absent from the rollup, so it cannot
#         turn `green` to 0. It matters only where the admin's bypass also covers the
#         required-checks rule; where the server enforces that rule (as on this plugin's
#         own repo) the merge is refused there.
#       - Any other rule the admin role can bypass and this script cannot see --
#         unresolved conversations, required deployments, code-scanning or merge-queue
#         rules -- is bypassed with it.
#       - Check or review state can change between the offer and the human's "yes";
#         --match-head-commit pins the commit, not its checks. Because the merge carries
#         --admin, this applies to a CLEAN offer too (gh's own re-check is switched off).
#       - `statusCheckRollup` may be capped by gh (believed 100 entries; unverified).
#     The human's confirmation, shown the ledger text, is what stands for all of these.
#   - A BLOCKED PR is offered only if the ACTIVE `gh` identity can bypass the
#     restrict-updates ruleset(s) (#250) -- not proof it can perform the whole merge: a
#     rule of another kind that the identity cannot bypass is not read here. `--admin` only switches off gh's client-side refusal; the server
#     applies the bypass per viewer. So for a BLOCKED PR this reads the rulesets with an
#     `update` rule on <base> (`gh api repos/<repo>/rules/branches/<base>`) and each
#     one's `current_user_can_bypass` (`gh api repos/<repo>/rulesets/<id>`):
#     `never` on any of them -> `refuse <N> bypass-never` (the caller names the identity
#     and sends the human to the web UI or a bypass-capable account); `always`,
#     `pull_requests_only` or `exempt` on all -> offered; no `update` rule at all -> the
#     restriction does not explain the BLOCKED, so `refuse <N> state-blocked`; a failed
#     call or any other value -> `unreadable`. A CLEAN PR needs no bypass and skips this.
#
# The branch prefix selects candidates; it is not a trust signal.
