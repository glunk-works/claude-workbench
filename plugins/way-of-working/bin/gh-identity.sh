# Which identity is acting: a human's login (user mode) or this repo's declared dev App
# (App mode)? One place that says so (WB-D24, #379), so no skill guesses it from a token
# prefix or from `gh auth status`, which reports scope, not who is acting. The same lookup
# also answers whether an issue, comment or PR AUTHOR is trusted (`author`, #382).
#
# Trust is by DECLARED identity, never by name alone (WB-D24 item 6): the acting account
# is matched against `identities` in .ai/project.yml on its numeric `id`, which a login
# rename cannot move. This script is a pure predicate. It calls no `gh`; the caller
# captures `gh` output first, with `&&`, and passes the values, so a failed call breaks
# the chain before this script runs and can never read as "no identity".
#
# Usage:
#   gh-identity.sh classify <login> <id> <project.yml>
#   gh-identity.sh author <login> <id> <project.yml>
#   gh-identity.sh role <login> <id> <project.yml>
#   <records> | gh-identity.sh reach <owner/repo>
#
#   LU=$(gh api user --jq '[.login, .id] | @tsv') &&
#   LOGIN=$(printf '%s' "$LU" | cut -f1) && ID=$(printf '%s' "$LU" | cut -f2) &&
#   gh-identity.sh classify "$LOGIN" "$ID" "$DEF_YML_FILE"
#
# That recipe is the USER-token source and is the only one this task measured. GitHub
# refuses `GET /user` to an installation token, so under an installation token it fails and the
# chain stops: App mode is then unreachable by this source, and fails closed. Where the
# {login, id} of an App actor comes from is the caller's to establish (for example the
# `user` object of a write response, MEASURED in #380: an issue or PR the dev App token created
# reported its `user` as the App's `[bot]` login and numeric id, which `classify` returned as `app`);
# classify is source-agnostic and only compares what it is given. That source arrives only AFTER a
# write, so it cannot gate the first one. A GitHub App USER-to-server token is different: it may
# call `GET /user` and returns the human it acts for, so it classifies as that human.
#
# `user` is a MODE, never a trust grant. With identities null it is printed for any plain
# account (the pre-cutover model trusts by author_association, not by this word); with a map
# it means a declared maintainer. A reader that gates TRUST on a maintainer must run against
# a map and must not treat `user` from a null file as one.
#
# classify prints exactly one word to stdout and exits 0:
#   user  -- identities is null (the repo has not cut over) and the login is a plain
#            account, OR the id and login match an `identities.maintainer` entry
#   app   -- the id and login match `identities.dev_app`
# It exits 2, printing NOTHING to stdout, when it cannot say; one stderr line gives the
# reason. The CALLER decides policy for 2: treat it as neither mode, and wait. Unsure is:
#   - login or id missing, or not the shape GitHub reports (login: letters, digits, `-`,
#     optional `[bot]`; id: a positive integer)
#   - .ai/project.yml unreadable, no `identities` key (absent is the unanswered question),
#     or `identities` neither null nor a map
#   - identities is null and the login ends `[bot]` -- an App with no declared identity is
#     never assumed to be the user model
#   - the id matches reviewer_app or loop_app -- a declared identity, but not one of the
#     two modes this predicate answers; those Apps do not run the dev flow
#   - the account is not declared at all, or the id matches an entry whose login differs
#     (a rename or a stale declaration: do not guess which side is right)
#   - an entry is malformed. A malformed entry (not a map, a non-integer or non-positive
#     `id`, a non-string `login`) matches nothing -- never by login alone -- so a file whose
#     only matching entry is malformed reads as undeclared. `identities.maintainer` must be a
#     sequence; a map there is malformed. YAML aliases inside `identities` are expanded before matching; `identities` itself must not be an alias (that reads as not a map).
#   - one id is declared more than once, under one role or several: do not guess which.
# Login comparison is case-insensitive (GitHub logins are); the id is exact.
#
# author is the TRUST predicate (WB-D24, #382): is the author of an issue, a comment or a PR
# one this repo trusts? `author_association` is viewer-relative -- read through an App token,
# the maintainer's own issue reads CONTRIBUTOR -- so a repo that has cut over trusts by
# declared {login, id} instead. It shares classify's lookup and so its exit-2 cases for bad
# input (a bad login or id, an unreadable or absent file or key, a non-map `identities`, an
# id declared twice or under another login) -- but NOT classify's refusals of an undeclared
# account, a reviewer or loop App, or a `[bot]` under null, which are `untrusted` / `legacy`
# here. It prints exactly one word:
#   trusted    -- the id and login match an `identities.maintainer` entry. Only a maintainer's
#                 authorship is trusted (the schema: "every account whose reaction or
#                 authorship is trusted"); the dev App's own text is NOT, so an agent cannot
#                 write the spec it later obeys.
#   untrusted  -- identities is a map and the account is the dev, reviewer or loop App, or is
#                 not declared at all. A hostile account is a normal input, not an error.
#   legacy     -- identities is null: this repo has not cut over, and the CALLER falls back
#                 to its pre-WB-D24 `author_association` allowlist. Never a trust grant.
# A caller that gets exit 2 treats it as neither trusted nor untrusted, and waits.
#
# role is the lookup itself, for a caller that needs WHICH declared account is acting
# (token-check.sh, #436). It prints maintainer, dev_app, reviewer_app or loop_app; undeclared
# when identities is a map and the account is not in it; legacy when identities is null.
# Exit 2 only on bad input (the cases author shares: a bad login or id, an unreadable or absent
# file or key, a non-map identities, an id declared twice or under another login). Unlike
# classify it does NOT refuse an undeclared account, a reviewer or loop App, or a [bot] under null.
#
# reach is the App-mode probe: is the token in use an installation token that can reach
# <owner/repo>? Feed it one `full_name` per line from
#   gh api --paginate installation/repositories --jq '.repositories[].full_name'
# captured to a file first. A user token cannot call that endpoint, so a failed call is the
# caller's "not an App token", and must not reach this script as empty input.
#   reached    -- <owner/repo> is listed (compared case-insensitively)
#   unreached  -- records arrived, none is <owner/repo>
# Exits 2, nothing on stdout, for empty input (a call that returned nothing is not "an
# installation with no access"), a malformed <owner/repo> or record. A reached probe says
# the token is an installation token with access; WHICH App it is stays the answer of `role` (token-check.sh) or `classify`.
#
# The caller reads `.ai/project.yml` from the DEFAULT branch's committed copy, never the
# working tree (the same stance as `orchestration` and the review gate): a PR under review
# can edit its own `identities`.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh, tr(1), yq (mikefarah v4) for classify, author and role.
