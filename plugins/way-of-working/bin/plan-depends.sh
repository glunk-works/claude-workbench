# Reads one issue's confirmed `depends_on` marker back out of a milestone description's
# **Build order:** list -- the record /way-of-working:plan-sprint writes for a NEW milestone
# (its Sequence confirm step) so a reader, and later the orchestrator driver, can get the
# human-confirmed independence of a task without reading any issue body as an instruction.
#
# Usage:
#   plan-depends.sh read <description-file> <issue-number>
#     <description-file> holds the milestone description, fetched by the caller (the same
#     direct-redirection pattern plan-gather.sh's header names); <issue-number> is digits only.
#     Prints exactly one line, always exit 0 (the verdict is on stdout, like plan-anchor.sh):
#       independent            the marker is `none`: no other task must finish first, so the
#                              task may run in the same wave as any other independent one
#       after <N> [<N>...]     the marker names these earlier build-order issues: the task
#                              waits for every one of them
#       all-earlier <reason>   the task depends on EVERY earlier build-order item --
#                              the item waits for every earlier item. The fail-closed reading, and the ONLY reading of
#                              anything this script cannot confirm. <reason> is one of:
#                                unconfirmed  the item has no marker at all
#                                not-listed   the issue is not in the Build order list
#                                unreadable   the file is missing, the list is malformed
#                                             (no or repeated header, numbering that is not
#                                             1..k, a repeated issue, a number with a leading
#                                             zero or over 9 digits), or this item's marker
#                                             is malformed, repeated, names an issue that is
#                                             not listed earlier, names the item itself, or
#                                             names the same issue twice
#     A usage error (wrong argument count, a non-digit issue number) exits 1 with a stderr
#     message and no stdout.
#
# The marker is the LAST thing on the item's line: ` [depends_on: none]` or
# ` [depends_on: #12, #14]`, comma-space separated. An item may wrap onto indented
# continuation lines; the marker is looked for at the end of the joined item. Exactly one
# `[depends_on:` per item -- a second one (a forged copy inside the reason text) makes the
# item unreadable rather than letting either copy win.
#
# What this does NOT claim: the description is editable by any write-level collaborator
# (reference/project-schema.md, the planning trust boundary). For the live sprint, the plan
# anchor's description hash is what binds this text; this script only parses what it is
# handed. A marker is a scheduling hint that can only ever be read as MORE serial, never
# less, when anything about it is doubtful.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh and awk. No jq, no yq, no gh.
