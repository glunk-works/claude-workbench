# Build, run PR code inside, and tear down an isolated sandbox for
# /way-of-working:architect-review's *Review by execution* step (issue #113).
#
# The step this replaces ran a PR's own code with the reviewing session's credentials
# via `git worktree add <tmp> <sha>`, which SHARES `.git` with the main checkout: PR
# code in the worktree could rewrite `.ai/project.yml` or `.git/config`'s `origin`
# before the *Compose and post* step re-read them (issue #113, from a security-critic
# finding on #98). Two design-spec revisions were posted on the issue; the first
# (a throwaway `git clone --no-local` under a stripped `env -i`) was superseded when a
# critic pass reproduced three vectors it claimed closed: `gh auth token`/`gh auth
# git-credential` reach the OS keyring regardless of what the process environment
# carries -- stripping the env removes the credential HANDLE, not the reach; PATH's
# first entry is a plantable shim directory PR code can write to; and `git clone
# <workspace>` leaves the absolute workspace path in the clone's own reflog and its
# `origin` remote config (verified live: a clone does NOT create FETCH_HEAD at all --
# that leak is specific to THIS design's single-ref fetch, below, not to clone), so
# "the attacker would have to guess the path" was false. The approved
# shape (option 1 on the issue: A+C+D now, a container -- option B -- filed for a
# later sprint with its own schema key) is implemented here as option A, corrected:
#
#   - `git init --template=<empty>` + a single-ref fetch FROM THE WORKSPACE replaces
#     `clone`: no local branches or tags copied, no `clone: from` reflog entry, no
#     `origin` remote to remove.
#   - The fetched ref lands at a namespace no other refspec writes
#     (`refs/review-sandbox/<N>` in the WORKSPACE, fetched from `refs/pull/<N>/head`),
#     so a concurrent review of a different PR, or a second run of this one, can't
#     collide with it.
#   - `FETCH_HEAD` is scrubbed from the sandbox immediately after the fetch, before
#     checkout -- the workspace's own path, which `fetch` records there verbatim, must
#     not be discoverable from inside code the sandbox then runs. (A single-ref fetch
#     with no destination branch, as used here, writes no reflog entry at all -- there
#     is nothing under `.git/logs` for the path to leak into. The `rm -rf .git/logs`
#     line stays as a harmless belt-and-braces no-op, not because it removes a real
#     leak.)
#   - `run` invokes the sandboxed command under a fixed, non-repo-specific env
#     allowlist (`env -i` plus PATH and a short OS-variable list) with HOME, TMP/TEMP/
#     TMPDIR and GH_CONFIG_DIR repointed inside the sandbox, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`,
#     `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` --
#     never the caller's own environment forwarded wholesale.
#
# What this closes: the CWD-relative form of every vector in the issue (a test that
# runs git in its own tree, sets config, installs hooks, moves refs); the config
# credential handles this process itself would otherwise forward through `run`
# (`credential.helper`, `hosts.yml` -- see the GH_TOKEN residual below, which this does
# NOT close); the FETCH_HEAD workspace-path leak; copied local branches; LFS and
# submodule reads during BOTH `make`'s fetch+checkout and `run` -- but by DIFFERENT
# means, neither a superset nor a subset of the other: `make`'s own git calls stay in
# the CALLER's full, unstripped environment (no `env -i`, no HOME/TMP/GH_CONFIG_DIR
# repoint, no `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` -- see the "does NOT close" list below, where this
# script says so directly), which `run` does not; `make` adds the three
# `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`/`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE` env vars `run` also
# uses, PLUS `-c submodule.recurse=false`, neutered `-c filter.lfs.*=`, and (on BOTH the
# sandbox fetch and the checkout that follows it, identically) `-c core.hooksPath`/
# `core.fsmonitor`/`core.pager`/`core.editor`/`diff.external=`, none of which `run`
# adds. An earlier revision of this
# header called `make`'s isolation a strict SUPERSET of `run`'s -- wrong, and
# self-contradicting against its own later claim (below) that `make` runs under the
# caller's full, unstripped environment; a later revision called it merely narrower --
# also wrong, since the `-c` overrides above are `make`-only. It is DIFFERENT, not
# ranked either way against `run`'s. An earlier version of this script applied any of
# this only inside `run`, leaving `make`'s own checkout to read system/global LFS config under
# the reviewer's full environment -- three independent critic passes on #113 found
# that gap by reading `make`'s checkout call against this claim; `make` itself now
# re-verifies trust (the same read `trust` does) before building anything, so an
# untrusted PR reaching `make` -- whether by a caller's own mistake or a PR's own text
# talking a confused caller into it -- is a mechanical STOP, not a rule that exists
# only in SKILL.md prose.
#
# What this does NOT close (verified during the design and repeated rounds of
# adversarial critic review -- see docs/decisions.md's WB-D13 for what each round
# found -- several items reproduced live -- stated so a caller never treats this as
# more than it is):
#   - `gh auth token` and `gh auth git-credential` still return the invoking user's
#     real credential from the OS keyring -- the keyring is reachable by any process
#     running as that user, one command away, whatever the process environment
#     carries.
#   - `env -i` strips only the DIRECT child's environment. `GH_TOKEN` (or any other
#     credential the invoking user's own shell exported) is still readable from an
#     ancestor process's environment -- `timeout`, the subshell `run` opens, this
#     script itself -- via `/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux and MSYS, by a same-uid
#     process, with no race and no prior compromise needed. Reproduced live during
#     review. This is not a gap in the allowlist; it is a property of what `env -i`
#     can and cannot reach, and nothing short of a different uid or namespace (the
#     container, option B) closes it.
#   - More generally, `run`'s stripped environment only changes what a tool finds BY
#     DEFAULT -- it is not a filesystem or network sandbox. Code running under `run`
#     has the invoking user's own uid and can read any file that uid can read (its
#     real `$HOME` is trivially findable -- `/etc/passwd`, an ancestor's
#     `/proc/<pid>/environ`, or just `/home/$USER`), including
#     `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` (a plaintext token whenever `gh` fell back from the
#     keyring), `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.ssh/id_*`, this session's own
#     `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, and an SSH agent socket -- and can send any of it
#     out over the network, which `run` does not restrict.
#   - A write that persists as the invoking user (a PATH directory, `~/.claude` or
#     `.claude/settings.local.json` hooks, a shell rc file) is not undone by `destroy`.
#     The WORKSPACE's own `.git/config` and `.git/hooks` are one instance of this class
#     worth naming directly: PR code, or a leftover process (below), can plant
#     `diff.external`, `url.<x>.insteadOf`, `core.fsmonitor`, or a filter plus
#     `.git/info/attributes` into the workspace's OWN config, which then runs under
#     the reviewer's full, unstripped environment the next time the reviewer's own
#     workspace git commands touch it (SKILL.md's own `git diff`, `make`'s `git fetch`,
#     `destroy`'s `update-ref`). The *Review by execution, in an isolated sandbox* /
#     *Compose and post* pre/post transcript snapshot (SKILL.md) only detects a
#     change to `.git/config` after the fact, and only records
#     `.git/hooks` file NAMES (`ls`, not a content hash), so it would not notice an
#     existing hook's contents being rewritten, nor a plant already present when the
#     snapshot itself is taken. A plant here is not only an EXECUTION route, either: a
#     rewritten `origin` or a planted `url.<x>.insteadOf` also REDIRECTS -- `read_trust`
#     resolves `{repo}` from `git remote get-url origin` (which `insteadOf` rewrites)
#     before either `trust` or `make` ever reads a PR, so a plant present before that
#     read can point an entirely LATER review's trust check and fetch at an
#     attacker-controlled repo, not merely execute code inside the one that planted it.
#     The pre/post snapshot is taken after that read, so it does not cover this. THE
#     SAME REDIRECT REACHES FURTHER, before this script is even invoked:
#     `bin/review-base-anchor.sh` resolves `{repo}` the identical way (`git remote
#     get-url origin`) as the FIRST thing `/way-of-working:architect-review` does, then
#     fetches and fast-forwards the reviewer's own LOCAL default branch onto whatever
#     that origin (redirected or not) actually holds, and the whole review session
#     then reads `.ai/project.yml` from that fast-forwarded tree -- verified live: a
#     plant present before that preflight runs is worse than redirecting this script
#     alone, because SKILL.md's own `{repo}` cross-check (comparing its config value
#     against this script's printed `repo=`) does NOT catch it -- both sides resolve
#     from the SAME redirected `origin`, so they agree with each other and with the
#     attacker, not with reality.
#   - The marker no longer carries the workspace path in the clear (a hash only -- see
#     `make`), but the path is discoverable other ways that need no prior compromise
#     either -- an ancestor process's cwd (`/proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux/MSYS), or simply
#     listing the filesystem for a directory holding `refs/review-sandbox/<N>`.
#   - A leftover process from an earlier `run` that this script's best-effort kill
#     failed to reach can still act while a later `make` rebuilds the same path, from
#     `git init` through the checkout that follows -- and REPRODUCED LIVE: the
#     checkout-time config isolation above stops it from reading SYSTEM/GLOBAL config,
#     and now neuters the SPECIFIC local-config values verified reachable during
#     design (`core.fsmonitor`, `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `diff.external`), but NOT
#     the class -- a `filter.<name>.smudge` planted locally, triggered by nothing more
#     than the PR's OWN `.gitattributes` naming that filter (no local plant of the
#     trigger needed, only of the filter definition), `core.alternateRefsCommand`,
#     `url.<x>.insteadOf`, and a same-named remote's `uploadpack` were all separately
#     confirmed live and are NOT neutered -- under `make`'s full (unstripped)
#     environment. This is worse, not merely present, on the one platform this repo's
#     maintainer runs on: Git Bash's process-group kill does not reach a detached
#     child at all (`(cmd &)` survives `run` returning, reparented to PID 1; confirmed
#     live, not merely "degrades gracefully" as an earlier revision of this note
#     claimed). It is not Windows-exclusive, though: on any platform, a command that
#     escapes the process group (`setsid cmd &`, any daemonizing double-fork -- NOT
#     only a deliberate one: `git gc --auto` (its default, `gc.autoDetach=true`,
#     survives `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` since that's a global-not-default
#     override), `gpg-agent`, `ssh-agent`, and ordinary build daemons -- Gradle,
#     Kotlin, sccache, `dotnet build-server` -- all do this routinely, with no hostile
#     intent) is reparented the same way and is just as unreachable by `run`'s
#     group-kill even where the group-kill otherwise works -- confirmed live for the
#     deliberate case; the ordinary-tool case follows from the same reparenting
#     mechanism. So a leftover process is the ORDINARY case on Windows and the
#     daemonizing case -- deliberate or not -- everywhere else, and this residual
#     should be read accordingly.
#   - `${REVIEW_SANDBOX_ROOT:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/review-sandbox}` defaults to a
#     predictable path under `/tmp` when `TMPDIR` is unset. On a shared, multi-user
#     Linux host (not this repo's maintainer's own machine, where `/tmp` is
#     per-user), another local user who can create or already owns that path could
#     race `make`/`run` there. Set `REVIEW_SANDBOX_ROOT` to a private, per-user
#     directory on any host where `/tmp` is shared.
#   - Closing any of the above fully needs unique-per-build paths, guaranteed
#     process-group teardown, filesystem/network sandboxing, and a different uid --
#     not attempted here, and no combination of `-c` flags on `make`'s own git
#     invocations gets there either.
# In short: this is ACCIDENT CONTAINMENT, not isolation from a deliberately hostile
# trusted-author PR -- the container (option B, filed as #158) is what closes that,
# and is scheduled separately. A caller posting a review after running code through
# `run` should say so, in those terms, not as "no link to credentials".
#
# Usage:
#   review-sandbox.sh trust <N>
#     One read: gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<N>, <repo> resolved from THIS checkout's
#     own `origin` (same derivation review-base-anchor.sh uses), never a script
#     argument. Prints `sha=<40hex> head_repo=<owner/name> base=<branch>
#     assoc=<association> trusted=0|1` to stdout and exits 0 whatever the verdict --
#     trusted=1 only when assoc is OWNER, MEMBER or COLLABORATOR AND head_repo equals
#     the resolved repo (a fork head is untrusted whoever opened the PR). A failed API
#     read is a STOP (exit 1); a non-numeric <N> is a malformed invocation (exit 2).
#
#   review-sandbox.sh make <N> <sha>
#     <sha> must be the 40-hex value `trust` printed -- validated, along with <N>,
#     BEFORE either reaches a refspec or argv. Re-reads trust itself (the same one
#     API call `trust` makes) and STOPs on an untrusted PR or a sha that disagrees
#     with this fresh read -- this subcommand refuses to build for an untrusted PR
#     regardless of what called it or why. Fetches refs/pull/<N>/head into
#     refs/review-sandbox/<N> in the CALLING checkout (the "workspace"), builds the
#     sandbox under ${REVIEW_SANDBOX_ROOT:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/review-sandbox}/<N>, verifies
#     the fetched commit inside the sandbox matches <sha> exactly, scrubs the
#     workspace-path leak, checks it out detached under LFS/config isolation of its
#     own (different from, not the same as, `run`'s -- see the header's "DIFFERENT, not
#     ranked either way" note), and prints the sandbox's path. Removes an existing
#     sandbox at that
#     path first, but ONLY when a sibling marker file's hash proves it belongs to this
#     same workspace and <N> -- never another review's, and the marker never carries
#     the workspace path in the clear.
#
#   review-sandbox.sh run <path> -- <cmd...>
#     <path> must be exactly a path `make` printed (canonicalized and checked against
#     the sandbox root plus a recorded marker, so `<root>/../x` and a symlink or
#     junction out of the root are refused before <cmd> ever runs). Runs <cmd> from
#     <path> under the stripped environment above, bounded by `timeout -k`, with a
#     best-effort kill of anything still running under <path> afterward. What is
#     PRINTED BACK to the caller is capped (REVIEW_SANDBOX_OUTPUT_CAP, default
#     1MiB) -- `head -c` reads only that many bytes, when `head` is on PATH; the
#     `cat` fallback (no `head`) prints the file whole, uncapped. Either way, what
#     <cmd> writes to its own captured-output file ON DISK is not capped at all --
#     the file can grow without limit until `timeout` fires (accident containment,
#     not a resource limit; <cmd> could already do this through its own TMPDIR
#     regardless).
#     A refusal BEFORE <cmd> starts prints STOP and exits with the RESERVED code 111 --
#     reserved because once <cmd> actually starts, ITS exit status is passed through
#     unchanged (as documented usage requires), and could coincidentally equal 111 too.
#     A caller must treat a leading `STOP` line on stderr, not the exit code alone, as
#     the authoritative refusal signal once <cmd> may have run.
#
#   review-sandbox.sh destroy <path>
#     Same root/marker guard as `run`. Never invokes git in the sandbox -- a hostile
#     core.hooksPath, clean.requireForce, or similar left in the sandbox's own config
#     must not get a chance to run on the way out. A symlink or junction found INSIDE
#     the sandbox is unlinked, never followed, before the recursive removal.
#
# Malformed invocation (bad arity, a non-numeric <N>, a non-40-hex <sha>, a missing
# `--` before <cmd>) is exit 2 throughout -- the question could not even be asked, the
# same split review-base-anchor.sh uses. A real STOP (well-formed but refused) is
# exit 1, except `run`'s own pre-execution refusal, which is 111 (see above).
#
# Permitted toolset: git, $REVIEW_SANDBOX_GH (default: gh), POSIX sh, `timeout`
# (ships in Git for Windows' usr/bin, same as the rest of this toolset), and
# `sha256sum` or `shasum -a 256` for the marker hash (same permitted pair
# plan-anchor.sh uses). No jq, no python.
#
# Windows note: the leftover-process kill after `run` does NOT reach a detached child
# under Git Bash -- confirmed live, not a theoretical gap: `(cmd &)` inside a `run`
# survives `run` returning, reparented to PID 1, whatever job control this script
# enables. See the "What this does NOT close" list above; this is the ordinary case on
# this platform, not an edge case. `tests/review-sandbox.test.sh`'s own leftover-
# process fixture is platform-aware: it treats a surviving leftover as this known,
# accepted residual (skip, not a silent pass) only on Windows (MSYS/MINGW/CYGWIN);
# everywhere else, where the group-kill is expected to reach an ordinary backgrounded
# child, the same finding is a FAIL. The `destroy` symlink/junction check
# (`find -type l`) is not similarly known-broken on Windows -- confirmed live that it
# DOES catch a `mklink /J` junction under Git Bash's `find`; untested by CI either way,
# see below.
#
# This repo's CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs Ubuntu only, and its `tests` job
# does not run `tests/review-sandbox.test.sh` at all yet (same as three other recent
# `bin/` test additions -- read `ci.yml`'s `tests` job directly for the current list;
# CLAUDE.md's "not yet a required check" / "not yet required" annotation is on EVERY
# test in that file (worded either way depending on the line), including ones CI does
# run, so it cannot answer "does CI run this at all"). So every
# Windows-specific path in this script is exercised only on a maintainer's machine,
# never mechanically.
