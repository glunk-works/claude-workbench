# Fail closed on a minted App token before anything acts with it (WB-D24, #436).
#
# The incident (#376 session 1): a reviewer token came out empty, `gh` treats an empty
# GH_TOKEN as unset, and four calls meant for the reviewer App ran as a human code owner
# with write access, from the host's stored login. Every consumer of a minted token (a
# review sandbox reading a reviewer token, a container reading an admin token, a broker, a
# loop driver) MUST run this check first, and go no further on a non-zero exit. (#436 ships
# the check; wiring each consumer is the task that adds that consumer, e.g. #389.) The check
# does not talk to GitHub: like gh-identity.sh it is a pure predicate, and the caller
# captures what GitHub said, with `&&`, so a failed call breaks the chain before this
# runs and can never read as "nothing wrong".
#
# Usage:
#   token-check.sh file <token-file>
#   token-check.sh token <token-file>
#   token-check.sh verify <role> <owner/repo> <token-file> <installation-file> <project.yml>
#                         [<actor-login> <actor-id>]
#
# The token file is what mint.sh writes: the token on line 1, its expires_at on line 2
# (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ), nothing else.
#
# file   prints `live` and exits 0 when the file is a regular file (not a link), holds exactly
#        those two lines, line 1 is a ghs_ installation token (ghs_ then 36 or more of
#        [A-Za-z0-9._-]) and line 2 is later than now. It exits 2, printing nothing to stdout,
#        for an empty, unreadable, malformed or expired file; one stderr line gives the reason
#        and never the token. A user token (ghp_, gho_, ghu_, github_pat_) is refused here by
#        shape, before any call is made with it.
#
# token  runs `file`, then prints line 1 and nothing else: the one place a consumer gets the
#        secret, in a variable, never on a command line or in a log:
#          TOK=$(token-check.sh token "$f") && [ -n "$TOK" ] || exit 1
#        The `&&` and the `[ -n ]` are the point. After this, hand the token to a child as
#        GH_TOKEN="$TOK" (or to curl through a stdin config, as mint.sh does), never as an
#        unset or empty variable: `gh` reads an empty GH_TOKEN as unset and falls back to the
#        stored login, which on a host is a human's. Inside a dev container there is none.
#
# verify proves the token is an installation token for the expected App, on top of `file`:
#   <role>              dev_app, reviewer_app or loop_app (a key of `identities`): the actor
#                       is REQUIRED. admin or any: no identity is declared for it (identities
#                       has no admin App), so only the installation proof applies and no actor
#                       may be given. Use `any` to accept, knowingly, that another App on the
#                       same repo is not told apart.
#   <installation-file> `GET /installation/repositories` made WITH THIS TOKEN, one full_name per
#                       line. Nothing here ties the file to the token, so the caller must make
#                       the call from the very value it will act with, in one chain, and act
#                       with that same $TOK:
#                         TOK=$(token-check.sh token "$f") && [ -n "$TOK" ] &&
#                         GH_TOKEN="$TOK" gh api --hostname github.com --paginate \
#                           installation/repositories --jq '.repositories[].full_name' >"$inst" &&
#                         token-check.sh verify <role> <owner/repo> "$f" "$inst" <yml> ...
#                       with GH_HOST and GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN unset. (A GITHUB_TOKEN from Actions is also
#                       ghs_ and would pass: this check is for the tokens mint.sh writes.) A user
#                       token cannot call that endpoint, so a caller whose call failed has no
#                       file, or an empty one, and this refuses (`gh-identity.sh reach` exits 2
#                       on no records). <owner/repo> must be listed, case-insensitively.
#   <actor-login> <actor-id>  the numeric id and login the token acts as. They MUST come from a
#                       GitHub response obtained with $TOK, never from `identities`, the mint
#                       config or any other statement of intent: a value copied from the thing it
#                       is compared with proves nothing. GET /user is refused to an installation
#                       token, and no other source has been measured yet, so until one is, `app`
#                       is not reachable by a real caller. They must match the declared
#                       `identities.<role>` entry, via `gh-identity.sh role`: a token of another
#                       App, a maintainer, or an account declared nowhere all fail. `identities`
#                       null cannot declare an actor, so a supplied actor then fails too.
#   prints `app`          installation token reaching <owner/repo>, actor is the declared <role>.
#   prints `installation` installation token reaching <owner/repo>; role admin or any, so WHICH App
#                         it is was not checked. Enough to refuse a user or empty token; NOT enough
#                         where another App is installed on the same repo.
#   exits 2, nothing on stdout, for everything else: a failed `file`, unreached or empty
#   installation records, a dev_app/reviewer_app/loop_app role without an actor, an actor that is
#   not the declared role, an actor given with admin or any, an unknown role, a wrong argument
#   count, and (only when an actor is given) an unreadable <project.yml>. The
#   caller treats 2 as "do not act", and does not retry with another credential.
#
# Assumed, not checked: the token directory is not writable by a less-privileged process (the
# file is read in several steps, and only its last path component is tested for a link).
#
# The caller reads <project.yml> from the DEFAULT branch's committed copy, never the working
# tree (a PR can edit its own `identities`). Expiry is compared with `date -u` at call time;
# the caller re-runs the check if it holds a token for long. Permitted toolset: POSIX sh, date,
# sed, tr, wc, dirname, and what gh-identity.sh needs (yq).
