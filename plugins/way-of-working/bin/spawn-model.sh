# Confirm which model a subagent spawn actually ran as, from harness-written evidence --
# never from the subagent's own report text (its prompt and the diff it read are
# attacker-influenceable, and agent bodies carry "(Opus by default)"/"(Sonnet by default)"
# wording that competes with reality anyway). This is the provenance check behind
# `models.second_opinion` (reference/project-schema.md § `agents`, `models`):
# `/way-of-working:critic-gate`'s one late round on a different model is recorded as having
# run on it only when this script answers `confirmed`. This is strong evidence, not
# unforgeable -- a critic holds Bash and could in principle rewrite its own transcript file
# after the fact; the every-record rule below defeats appending to fix a mixed-model round,
# and that residual rewrite risk is accepted explicitly, same as the spec that requires this
# script does (the harm ceiling is false provenance, not execution).
#
# Usage: spawn-model.sh <agent-id> <expected-alias>
#   <agent-id>        the id the Agent tool's own tool result names for the spawn
#                      (`toolUseResult.agentId` in the orchestrating session's transcript) --
#                      never a glob over `agent-*.jsonl`, so an earlier spawn cannot confirm
#                      a later round.
#   <expected-alias>  one of: sonnet | opus | haiku | fable (the schema's model names --
#                      reference/project-schema.md § `models.second_opinion` documents the
#                      legal ALIASES; the alias -> model-id PREFIX table below is this
#                      script's own, not documented a second time anywhere else).
#
# Prints exactly one of, to stdout, and always exits 0 (the caller decides policy):
#   confirmed    -- every assistant record found in the spawn's own transcript ran on a
#                   model id matching <expected-alias>'s prefix
#   mismatch     -- the transcript was read, but at least one assistant record's model does
#                   not match (including a record whose model field could not be read --
#                   appending to fix a mixed-model round must not confirm it)
#   unconfirmed  -- anything else: an unknown alias, no current session id (or one that
#                   isn't a plain id), no transcript file (zero or more than one candidate),
#                   an unreadable path, or no assistant record in the file at all (an empty
#                   projection)
#
# Locating the transcript. Claude Code writes each subagent's transcript to
#   ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<agent-id>.jsonl
# This script does not hardcode or re-derive <project-slug> -- that is exactly the kind of
# machine-specific string this plugin avoids baking in. Instead it matches on <session-id>,
# a literal value this session already holds in $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, which is unique --
# so the one wildcarded path segment is the slug directory whose exact spelling this script
# deliberately does not need to know, never the filename itself. That is not the "glob over
# agent-*.jsonl" this script's header rules out: the filename is fully specified by
# <agent-id> with no wildcard in it, and a session id resolving to more than one project-slug
# directory only means the lookup itself is ambiguous, which is exactly when this script
# must answer unconfirmed rather than guess.
#
# The model field. A record's `message` object carries its scalar header fields
# (`model`, `id`, `type`, `role`) BEFORE `content` -- verified against this repo's own real
# transcripts -- and `content` is where an assistant turn's own tool-call arguments live.
# So this script never searches the WHOLE line for `model`/`role`: it first cuts the line at
# the first `"content":` (POSIX parameter expansion, `${line%%"content":*}`, longest-suffix
# removal -- keeps everything before the FIRST occurrence), then looks for `"role":
# "assistant"` and `"model":"..."` only in that header slice. A tool call whose own arguments
# happen to carry a key named `model` (or a hand-crafted one, from a compromised critic)
# lives inside `content` and can therefore never reach either check -- reproduced against an
# earlier, whole-line-greedy version of this script during review, before this fix landed.
# Extraction within the header slice takes the FIRST `"model":"` there (again by parameter
# expansion, never a greedy sed `.*` pattern, which would silently prefer a later, wrong
# match on any line carrying more than one). The transcript's own content never reaches
# stdout, so it never re-enters the calling session's context the way re-reading the whole
# file for review would.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh only. No jq, no yq, no python -- this must run on any
# maintainer machine with nothing extra installed.
