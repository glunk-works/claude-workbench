# The deterministic predicate behind WB-D17 (#142) -- every dotted key path the
# schema documents must be PRESENT in a consuming repo's `.ai/project.yml`.
# `null` is the explicit "no value" wherever a key's own reference gives `null`
# a meaning; a key that is entirely absent is an unanswered question, never a
# silent default. Mirrors cursor-drift.sh's and plan-anchor.sh's shape: a
# predicate with a correctness argument, not a judgment call, so
# /way-of-working:resume's *Ensure the schema is complete* step and
# scripts/invariants-check.sh call this script rather than recomputing the
# check in prose.
#
# Usage:
#   schema-complete.sh check <file>
#     Prints, on stdout:
#       complete             -- every required key present and well-formed
#       incomplete           -- first line `incomplete`, then one line per
#                                finding:
#                                  missing <dotted.path> <kind>
#                                  invalid <dotted.path> <json-value>
#                                <kind> is one of: enum:<a>|<b>  nullable
#                                value  list  int. <json-value> is the OFFENDING
#                                value, compact JSON (`yq -o=json -I=0`),
#                                truncated. This is STRUCTURAL containment,
#                                not semantic neutralization: it keeps a
#                                malicious multi-line or fake-finding-shaped
#                                value from splitting across lines or forging
#                                a `missing `/`invalid ` line of its own (a
#                                JSON string literal can't open one), which
#                                matters because this file may be
#                                adversary-controlled on a branch other than
#                                the default (see resume/SKILL.md's *Check the
#                                branch-protection ruleset for drift* step
#                                and skills/resume/appendices/ruleset-migration.md,
#                                which reads a DIFFERENT copy of this same
#                                file for exactly that reason). It does NOT
#                                stop a quoted 200-character string from
#                                reading as an instruction to whatever later
#                                relays it in prose (a pick-up summary) --
#                                that reader must still treat the finding's
#                                value as data, never as something to act on,
#                                the same rule this schema's own § `planning`
#                                already states for a milestone description or
#                                issue body.

#                                YAML doesn't parse, or `yq` is not on PATH
#     Always exits 0 -- the verdict is stdout, the caller decides policy.
#
#   schema-complete.sh keys
#     Prints the required dotted key paths, one per line, in schema order.
#     The four `review.ci_gate.*` sub-keys and the five `orchestration.*` sub-keys
#     are suffixed ` if-map` -- each group is required only when its parent
#     (`review.ci_gate`, `orchestration`) itself resolves to a map, never when it
#     is `null`. `identities` itself is unsuffixed and its four sub-keys carry ` if-map`,
#     as `orchestration` does. `rulesets` is suffixed ` if-present` -- the one OPTIONAL
#     path: never reported when absent, validated when there (WB-D24 dual mode, below).
#     Always exits 0.
#
# The key set is NOT derived from `.ai/project.yml` or from walking any YAML
# at all -- it is the union of the dotted paths BOTH documented examples in
# `reference/project-schema.md` show (Full schema + Worked example), STOPPING
# AT SEQUENCES (`gates.green`, `load_bearing_docs`, `code_paths`,
# `ruleset.*` lists are leaves; their elements are values, never keys of
# their own). Enum value sets (`planning.kind`, `backlog.kind`, `models.*`)
# are hardcoded below, not derived from the doc -- `scripts/invariants-check.sh`
# is what holds this list and the doc in sync, by set equality on `keys`'
# own output (conditional suffix stripped) against a real path-walk of both
# example blocks. A key present in `.ai/project.yml` but not in this list is
# ignored, never flagged -- two plugin versions may write the same file, and
# an unknown extra key is not this script's business.
#
# --- Presence vs. null, the whole point of this script -------------------
#
# A plain `yq eval '.a.b' file` traversal returns the literal string `null`
# BOTH when `.a.b` is present with an explicit null value AND when it is
# entirely absent -- yq does not distinguish the two on a bare path read
# (confirmed live: `.a.d` on a document with no `d` key under `a` prints
# `null`, tag `!!null`, exit 0, identical to `.a.b: null`). `has("key")`
# is what distinguishes them, and confirmed live to degrade gracefully
# rather than error when the node it's called on is itself null, a scalar,
# a sequence, or simply absent (`.x | has("y")` on a document with no `x`
# key at all still answers `false`, not an error) -- so a single-shot
# `<parent> | has("<lastseg>")` query is enough per key, with no need to
# walk each intermediate segment by hand.
#
# --- `invalid` is also a shape check for the routing keys ------------------
#
# `repo`/`backlog.repo` must match `owner/name` (checked in pure POSIX
# parameter expansion -- exactly one `/`, non-empty on both sides).
# `pr_base`/`migration_base` must round-trip through `git check-ref-format
# --branch` -- comparing the OUTPUT back to the input, not just the exit
# status, because `--branch` expands shorthand like `@{-1}` (the same
# reasoning `bin/review-base-anchor.sh`'s header records for the identical
# check there; a value spelled `-Cmain` reaching a later `git switch`
# un-checked is the exact bug that check guards against).
#
# All four also pass through `is_safe_chars`: every byte must be in
# `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]`. These are the keys OTHER skills interpolate, unsanitized,
# into shell command templates the model builds at runtime (a branch-cut, a
# `gh pr create --base {pr_base}`, a `[ "$R" != "{repo}" ]` comparison) --
# neither the owner/name split nor `check-ref-format` alone rejects shell
# metacharacters (a security-critic pass confirmed `repo: "a/b $(id)"` and
# ``pr_base: "m$(id>&2)"`` both read `complete` before this guard existed).
# `complete` on these four keys means safe to interpolate, not merely
# shape-plausible.
#
# --- What this script deliberately does NOT check --------------------------
#
# Cross-key consistency (`planning.kind: github_milestones` with
# `backlog.kind: file`; `backlog.kind: file` with `backlog.path: null`) is
# out of scope -- those are already documented config errors with their own
# reporting in the skills that hit them, and folding them in here would make
# this a validator, not a completeness check. `models.*` values are checked
# against the harness's known model names as a courtesy, not because this
# script is the enforcement point for that set changing.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh, `yq` (mikefarah v4 -- the python `yq` has a
# different syntax; `yq --version` in a fixture-less environment is the
# caller's job to confirm, not this script's), and `git` (check-ref-format
# only, the same narrow use `review-base-anchor.sh` makes of it). `yq`
# missing from PATH is `unreadable`, never treated as "no findings, therefore
# complete" -- `complete` needs positive evidence, exactly like
# `plan-anchor.sh`'s header states for its own `unreadable` cases.
#
# --- One yq call per key table, not per key (#189) -------------------------
#
# Every fact the checks need (present, tag, charset, compact JSON) is read in ONE
# `yq` expression per table, because process spawns dominate on Git Bash: the
# per-key form took ~100 spawns and ~3.6s per run (the fixture suite, ~2m15s).
# The `has()` query above is therefore `select(tag == "!!map") | has(...)`, which
# also reads as absent under a scalar parent instead of failing the whole call.
# Consequences kept on purpose, each with a fixture:
#   - rows must match the key table exactly, in order, else `unreadable` (a
#     multi-document file, or any row a value could forge, is never `complete`);
#   - the tag field is a closed set inside yq (a verbatim `!<..%0A..>` tag is
#     percent-decoded by yq into a real newline);
#   - an enum value must also pass the charset test, so `models.coder: "opus\n"`
#     is now `invalid` (it used to pass, via the lossy `$(...)` capture);
#   - a root that is a sequence is `unreadable` (yq refuses to index it -- a side
#     effect, not a deliberate check); a scalar, null or empty root still reads
#     `incomplete` with every key `missing`, as before;
#   - a trailing empty document (`---` after the content) is `unreadable` too;
#     it used to read every key `missing`, because yq answered once per document
#     (`true` then `false`), which never equalled `true`;
#   - a present child under a custom-tagged parent map (`planning: !custom`) reads
#     `missing`, because the guard requires the literal `!!map` tag. Fails closed,
#     and an exotic form; `yq`'s `kind` operator would restore the old answer.
# Needs a yq with `to_json(0)`, `to_string`, `//` and `select`; verified on
# v4.53.6. An older yq that cannot parse the expression prints `unreadable`.
