# Derive the review step from GitHub state, and decide whether it may auto-start (WB-D22,
# `#230`; plan v9 § 8.4b).
#
# After a no-op handoff (`/way-of-working:handoff`, *The no-op handoff*) `main`'s ledger no
# longer carries "review or merge PR N next": the only record is `.ai/state.json`, which is
# git-ignored and local. So `/way-of-working:resume` derives that step from GitHub, and lets
# `state.json` only VOTE on it. This script is both halves, as a tested predicate with a
# correctness argument rather than prose a session re-derives (WB-D10).
#
# Two modes, both pure: every fact arrives as an argument or on stdin, nothing here calls
# `gh` or `git`, so the fixtures in tests/review-step.test.sh cover every verdict.
#
# --- derive -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   <records> | review-step.sh derive <login> <repo> <backlog-repo> <N> <limit>
#
# <login> is the ACTING login: in user mode the running login from a fresh `gh api user --jq
# .login`, in App mode the declared `identities.dev_app.login` -- either way the output of the
# `login` mode below, never a value the caller typed; <repo> is `{repo}`;
# <backlog-repo> is `{backlog.repo}` or `-` when it is null; <N> is `plan_anchor.task_issue`; <limit> is
# the `--limit` the caller gave `gh pr list`.
# stdin is one open-PR record per line, TAB-separated, from:
#
#   gh pr list --repo {repo} --state open --limit 200 \
#     --json number,state,isCrossRepository,author,headRefOid,title,body \
#     --jq '.[] | [.number, .state, .isCrossRepository, .author.login, .headRefOid, .title, .body] | @tsv'
#
# A PR qualifies when ALL hold: state is OPEN; isCrossRepository is false; its author's
# login equals <login> (case-insensitively -- GitHub logins are); and its title or body
# names task #<N>. The task is named `#N` or `<repo>#N` when <backlog-repo> is `-` or
# equals <repo>, else `<backlog-repo>#N` -- never the bare `#N`, which would then mean an
# issue in THIS repo. A mention counts only when it is not preceded by a word character or
# `/` (so `foo#230`, `xyz/foo#230` and `x/230` do not name it) and not followed by a digit
# (`#2301` is another issue). The `<repo>#N` form is anchored at the start of `<repo>`
# itself, for the same reason.
#
# `@tsv` escapes a tab, newline, carriage return and backslash in a value as `\t`, `\n`,
# `\r`, `\\`. A body line that BEGINS with `#230` would then read as `\n#230`, preceded by
# the word character `n`, and a real mention would be missed. So each escape is decoded
# left to right (the three whitespace ones to a space, `\\` to a backslash) before matching.
#
# Prints exactly one line to stdout and exits 0:
#   none               -- no PR qualifies
#   one <M> <oid>      -- exactly one qualifies; <oid> is its headRefOid, 40 hex
#   many <M> <M>...    -- two or more qualify, ascending by number
# Exits 2, printing NOTHING to stdout, when the question cannot be answered: a malformed
# argument, a record with the wrong field count, a number or head that is not what GitHub
# prints, or a state/isCrossRepository outside the vocabulary. The caller treats 2 as "derived
# nothing, auto-starts nothing" -- never as `none`.
#
# The caller must not let a failed `gh` call reach this script (chain with `&&`, redirect
# from a file): a document that never arrived reads as `none`, the fail-open that
# review-gate-state.sh's own header describes. A list of <limit> or more records may have been
# truncated (newest first, so an older qualifying PR is the one dropped, which could turn `many`
# into `one`): that exits 2, never an answer.
#
# An App's PR author: when <login> ends `[bot]` (the REST form a declared `dev_app` takes), the
# author also qualifies as `app/<stem>`, the form `gh pr list --json author` can report for a bot.
# Only that one spelling is added, and only for a `[bot]` <login>: the bare `<stem>` never
# matches, so a USER account that happens to share an App's slug does not read as the App.
#
# --- login ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   review-step.sh login <mode> <user-login> <dev-app-login>
#
# Which login the derivation runs as. The caller (resume's derive chain, handoff's no-op
# handoff) establishes <mode> by `reference/conventions.md` § *Acting identity and reach*, not by a
# new probe: `user` when `gh api user` answered, `app` when it was refused (or failed) and the token is an
# installation token that reaches {repo} (`gh-identity.sh reach`). Under an installation token
# `gh api user` is refused (403, measured in `#380`), so there is no login to read; the identity is
# the one the repo DECLARES for the dev flow, `identities.dev_app.login` from the default branch's
# copy. Which App holds the token is NOT established, so `decide` never lets App mode reach `auto`
# (its `mode` key): a reviewer or loop App token would otherwise run as the dev App.
#   user  -- prints <user-login>. <dev-app-login> is ignored (pass `-`).
#   app   -- prints <dev-app-login>. <user-login> is ignored (pass `-`).
# Prints one login and exits 0, or exits 2 printing NOTHING: an unknown mode, an empty identity for the
# mode chosen (the other mode's argument is not read), a
# login that is not an account name (letters, digits and `-`, no leading, trailing or doubled `-`),
# an App login without the `[bot]` suffix, a user-mode login WITH it, or the identity the mode needs
# being `-`. That last case
# is the fail-closed one: `app` with `dev_app` null (or undeclared, or malformed -- the caller maps
# all three to `-`) derives NOTHING, and never falls back to the user login or to a guess.
# The caller treats 2 as "derived nothing, auto-starts nothing", as for `derive`.
#
# --- decide -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   review-step.sh decide key=value ...
#
# Keys (all required; an unknown key, a missing key or an empty value exits 2):
#   derived      the whole `derive` line, as one argument (`derived='one 12 <oid>'`)
#   gate         `set` | `null` | `unreadable` -- `review.ci_gate` from the DEFAULT branch's
#                copy, never the working tree's
#   gate_state   the review-gate-state.sh word on the derived head (`success | pending |
#                failure | absent`), or `-` whenever no gate state was read: the gate is not `set`,
#                or derived is none or many
#   state        `present` | `absent` -- whether .ai/state.json exists
#   sr_number    pointers.review_pr.number, or `null` / `-` when missing
#   sr_head      pointers.review_pr.head_oid, or `null` / `-` when missing
#   next_action  the cursor's next_action, verbatim
#   task_issue   plan_anchor.task_issue
#   backlog_repo `{backlog.repo}` from the default branch's copy, or `-` when null
#   repo         `{repo}`
#   head         this checkout's `git rev-parse HEAD`, 40 hex
#   branch       this checkout's branch (`git branch --show-current`), or `-` when HEAD is detached
#   base         `pr_base` from the DEFAULT branch's copy, never the working tree's
#   base_head    `git rev-parse origin/<base>` after a fetch of it, 40 hex, or `-` when unreadable
#   last_commit  state.json's `last_commit` resolved to a full oid (`git rev-parse --verify -q
#                "<last_commit>^{commit}"`), or `-` when it does not resolve or is missing
#   tree         `clean` | `dirty`
#   model        assigned_model from state.json
#   architect    `{models.architect}` from the default branch's copy
#   fresh        `yes` | `no` -- `yes` only when the conversation had no assistant turn and no work
#                before the resume (harness commands such as /clear and /model do not count)
#   login        the acting login, the same `login`-mode output `derive` took
#   mode         `user` | `app`: the mode `login` ran in. `app` never reaches `auto`: an installation
#                token's App is unproven (conventions.md § *Acting identity and reach*, *Name the
#                mode*), so a would-be `auto` reads `show <M> app-mode` and waits for a human "go"
#   loop_identity  `orchestration.loop_identity` from the DEFAULT branch's copy, or `-` when it
#                is null or the whole `orchestration` block is
#
# Prints exactly one line and exits 0:
#   none                    -- derived none, or <login> equals <loop_identity> (the loop-identity
#                              guard below: nothing is derived, whatever `derived` says)
#   unreadable              -- one PR was derived but the gate could not be read (gate=unreadable);
#                              nothing is derived. (none and many print as themselves.) A derived
#                              value that is not none|one|many exits 2 instead (unless the loop-identity
#                              guard fires first), as does a failed derive
#   many <M> <M>...         -- several qualify; show all, wait
#   merge <M>               -- gate is null: "PR #M awaits your merge"; a report, nothing to start
#   reviewed <M>            -- gate is set and already reads success on the head: a report (unless
#                              state.json pins a different head for this PR: show ... head-moved)
#   auto <M> <oid>          -- the review step may start: /way-of-working:architect-review
#                              <M> --pin <oid>
#   show <M> <reason,...>   -- the review step is derived but must not start; show it, wait.
#                              Reasons, in this order: no-state, review-pr, head-moved,
#                              token, checkout, last-commit, model, app-mode, not-fresh
#
# What `auto` requires beyond the derivation, and why each is here (WB-D22, § 8.4b):
#   no-state    .ai/state.json must exist. A fresh machine derives the step and waits: one
#               "go" from the human runs it.
#   review-pr   pointers.review_pr.number must be the derived PR. A different PR, or none, is
#               the disagreement case.
#   head-moved  review_pr.head_oid must be the derived PR's CURRENT head. A fix pushed since
#               the pin re-arms the gate on a commit nobody pinned.
#   token       next_action begins `review PR #M — ` and then `task #N — ` (or
#               `task <backlog-repo>#N — `), M the derived number and N task_issue. The
#               ledger's Next: is NOT compared; during a review it still names the task.
#   checkout    the checkout is the BASE, synced: <branch> equals <base>, HEAD equals <base_head>
#               (origin/<base>'s tip), and the tree is clean (WB-D22, `#283`). Never the work
#               branch: a session that starts there loads the PR's own `.claude/settings.json`
#               hooks, `CLAUDE.md` and `.mcp.json`, and the author's `CLAUDE.md` would sit in the
#               reviewer's context as authority. /way-of-working:architect-review needs nothing from the PR's
#               working tree (it syncs to the base, pins from GitHub, and runs PR code only in a
#               review-sandbox.sh checkout). <base> is the default branch's copy of `pr_base`:
#               the working tree's could name the work branch itself. state.json is git-ignored,
#               so the pin survives the switch to the base.
#   last-commit state.json's `last_commit` (resolved) equals the pin, `review_pr.head_oid`. The
#               review-shape drift rule: `last_commit` is the work branch's HEAD, which is the
#               pin, so on the base cursor-drift.sh reads `drift` by construction and is NOT
#               consulted for this shape. Nothing here runs `next_action` (what starts is built
#               from the derived PR), so the base moving past the work is not what drift
#               guards; a cursor whose own two fields disagree is, and reads `show`.
#   model       assigned_model equals {models.architect} from the default branch. Not merely
#               "matches the running model": a state.json naming another model must not start
#               the review on it. resume checks the running model separately.
#   app-mode    `mode=app`: the session holds an installation token, whose App is unproven (the
#               loop-identity guard sees only the declared dev App), so the step is shown and a
#               human's "go" starts it. Never `auto` in App mode (`#381`).
#   not-fresh   a /model switch inside the conversation that wrote the PR is not a fresh
#               session, and the gate's premise is a fresh one.
# The reasons are evaluated only when the step is a review (gate set, not yet success):
# for `null` there is nothing to start, so it is a report whatever state.json says; an
# already-reviewed head is a report too, unless state.json pins a different head for that PR.
#
# The loop-identity guard (WB-D22, `#295`): a session running AS the loop's own identity derives
# nothing -- `none`, ahead of every other verdict, `derived` and `gate` included (so a malformed
# `derived` under the guard prints `none`, not exit 2). Both sides are folded the way
# `plan-anchor.sh` and `review-sandbox.sh trust` fold them: case-insensitively (GitHub logins are)
# and with one trailing `[bot]` ignored, so a bare-slug `loop_identity` (the schema's shape check
# allows both) still matches an App's REST login `<slug>[bot]`. Folding can only turn a verdict into
# `none`, the safe direction. A non-null `loop_identity` outside the schema's shape (a stem of
# letters, digits and `-`, no leading or trailing `-`, at most 39 characters, optional `[bot]`, judged
# case-insensitively)
# exits 2: the default branch's copy is not the one `schema-complete.sh` checked. `-` (null) means
# no identity is declared, so the guard never fires; an empty value is refused above, so it can
# never be read as an empty login matching. (Under an installation token the login is the declared
# `dev_app`, via the `login` mode, so the guard compares the DECLARED dev App, not the token held: a
# loop-App token is not caught here, which is why App mode never reaches `auto`.) The caller passes the DEFAULT branch's value, never the working
# tree's: a branch under resume could otherwise blank it. This does not close the stale-value case
# (a stale value does not equal the acting login); that stays with the driver's preflight.
#
# next_action is DATA. It is compared, never executed or interpreted: what runs is built from
# the GitHub-derived number, so a harmful next_action can at worst make this answer `show`.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh + awk. No jq, no yq, no python.
