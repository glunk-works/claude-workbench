# Resume appendix — why auto-start is not a lost approval

Loaded on demand; nothing in the auto-start decision depends on reading it.

   **Why auto-start is not a lost approval:** the `next_action` was written by the
   previous session's `/way-of-working:handoff` — which the human approved by merging its
   cursor-sync PR. A merge through the *Offer to merge a forgotten cursor-sync PR* step's
   confirmation approves the `next_action` itself, shown beside the ledger; a merge on GitHub
   approves the ledger's **Next:**, which `next_action` should match but which nothing
   compares (`WB-D20`). A cursor whose PR is still open was never approved, which is why
   that step's other outcomes wait.
   Re-approving it at the start of the next session approves the same decision twice, and
   in practice that second approval is a content-free "go" the overwhelming majority of the
   time. The approval that carries real signal is the **`hitl_gate`**, and it is still
   absolutely enforced. Auto-start removes a rubber stamp, not a gate. It also never
   crosses a merge boundary: `/way-of-working:critic-gate` still proposes and the human still
   picks, and the human still merges. One derived step is the exception to "nothing here posts
   a review" (`WB-D22`): after a no-op handoff, the *Derive the review step from GitHub*
   step's `auto` verdict starts `/way-of-working:architect-review <M> --pin <oid>` — the first
   review this plugin posts without a human approving that step. It rests on the derivation
   (GitHub state the session cannot shape, the default branch's gate, a fresh session, the
   pin), not on `next_action`, which nobody approves in that shape; the review is still never
   an approval or a merge. The cost is `WB-D20`'s display property for that one shape: the
   `next_action` is not shown beside a merged ledger, since it never reaches `main`.
