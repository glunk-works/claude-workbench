# Global Conventions (portable skill repository)

Referenced from the lean root `CLAUDE.md`. This is the engine's **global
directive/skill repository**: repo-agnostic ground rules the personas load as
conventions, and the block the bootstrapping/maintenance workflows inject into
every managed `glunk-works` repo. Keep it self-contained — no references to
files that only exist in *this* repo — so it stays valid when copied elsewhere.
Names in braces (`{roadmap}`, `{gates.green}`, …) are keys each repo sets in its own
`.ai/project.yml`; the schema that defines them travels with the plugin that injects
this file.

## Python conventions
- **Formatting is not negotiable:** `ruff format` (line length 100) is the single source of truth; never hand-format against it. Lint with `ruff check` under rule sets `E, F, I, B, S` (pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, bugbear, bandit). Import order is isort-managed — do not hand-order.
- **No `# noqa` without an inline justification** on the same line (`# noqa: RULE — reason`). A bare `# noqa` fails review.
- Target `python >= 3.12`. Full type hints on public functions; prefer `X | None` over `Optional[X]`, `list`/`dict` over `typing.List`/`Dict`.
- **No hardcoded secrets anywhere** — not in source, tests, or committed state/snapshot files. Credentials come from the OS keyring (or the documented double-gated CI fallback), never CLI flags or plain env vars.
- Every Pydantic-validated I/O boundary needs a test proving invalid input is rejected. Pin dependencies to CVE-free versions and regenerate the SBOM whenever deps change.

## OpenTofu / IaC conventions
- Format with `tofu fmt`; every change must pass `tofu validate` with exit 0 (this is the deterministic gate — no LLM judges IaC).
- One concern per module; expose inputs via `variables.tf`, outputs via `outputs.tf`, pin provider **and** module versions (no floating `latest`).
- Remote, locked state only — never commit `.tfstate` or `.terraform/`. No secrets in `.tf` or `.tfvars`; source them from the secret manager at plan/apply time.
- Name resources `snake_case`; tag every resource with owner + managing-repo so the factory can attribute drift.

## Commit / PR conventions

- Commits are small, self-contained, and green (`ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + the test suite all pass before committing). Sign commits.
- PRs target the integration branch (`develop`), never `main`/`master` directly, and never auto-merge — human review or remote CI validation is always required before merge.
- A change touching a versioned state schema must bump its `schema_version` and extend the migration path in the same commit.

### Message grammar: Conventional Commits

```
type(scope): imperative subject, lower-case, no trailing period
                                            <- 72 chars max
<blank>
Body: why the change exists and what it trades off. Wrap at 80.
Not a restatement of the diff — the diff is already in the commit.
<blank>
Sprint: 31
Finding: F-RALPH-FALSE-COMPLETION
Co-Authored-By: ...
```

- **`type`** is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`,
  `revert`. There is deliberately **no `style`** — the formatter owns formatting, so a
  style-only commit should not exist.
- **`scope`** is the module the change lives in, drawn from the repo's *enforced module
  boundaries* (in this engine: `core`, `personas/ralph`, `tools/mcp`, `tools/git_io`,
  `flows`, `trigger`, `mcp_servers`, `ci`, …). The commit vocabulary and the
  architectural vocabulary are deliberately the same words — if a change doesn't fit one
  scope, that is a signal it is really two commits.
- **`!` marks a breaking change** (`feat(core)!:`). For a versioned-state repo this has a
  precise meaning: a `State` shape break, which must carry a `schema_version` bump and a
  migration-path extension **in the same commit** (see above). The `!` makes that
  visible in one line of `git log`.
- **The type prefix is not a licence for a vague subject.** `fix(personas/ralph): fix bug`
  is worse than no convention at all. The subject still has to say what changed:
  `fix(personas/ralph): gate task completion on successful edit application`.
- **Trailers link a commit to the project's own ID space** — `Sprint: NN`,
  `Finding: <ID>`, `Closes: #N`. This is what makes "which commit closed this finding?"
  a `git log --grep` instead of an archaeology session.

### PR titles use the same grammar — and are the enforced surface

The merge is a squash, so **the PR title becomes the commit subject on the integration
branch**. It is therefore the only message that must be well-formed, and the only one
worth a CI check (`pr-title` job). Commits *within* a branch may be messy WIP; the
history that survives is the PR title. Enforcing every WIP commit buys nothing and adds
friction mid-sprint.

### Branch names

`sprint/NN-slug` for planned sprint work; `feat|fix|chore|docs/slug` for one-offs.
The prefix matches the commit `type` the branch will land as.

### Merge method: squash by default, merge-commit for integration → main

- **Squash-merge every ordinary PR.** The sprint (not the individual task commit) is the
  atomic unit: it is reviewed, archived, and attributed to a finding as one thing, and
  you would never want to revert half of it. Squashing also means **every commit on the
  integration branch is known-green** — WIP commits inside a branch are never CI'd on
  their own, only the PR head is. Keep the squash *message* set to the branch's commit
  messages, so per-task rationale and the `Sprint:`/`Finding:` trailers survive in the
  body and stay greppable.
- **Set the squash *title* source to the PR title, not "PR title or commit details."**
  With the default, a **single-commit PR silently uses the commit subject instead**,
  bypassing the CI-validated PR title entirely. The `pr-title` gate is only real once
  this is set.
- **Merge-commit (never squash) the long-lived integration branch into `main`.** Squashing
  that PR would collapse the entire multi-sprint effort into one commit and destroy the
  history. This is the one deliberate exception to the default.
- **Enable "automatically delete head branches."** A squash-merged branch is dead (its
  original commits are still "unmerged" against the new squashed commit and will
  conflict). Auto-deletion makes that structural rather than remembered — you cannot push
  to a branch that no longer exists.

### Push identity: `git` and `gh` can silently disagree

On some machines, `git push` and `gh` resolve GitHub identity through **different**
mechanisms and can disagree without either tool reporting it. `gh` prefers a `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable when one is set (the common case in CI, devcontainers,
and Codespaces) and otherwise falls back to its keyring's active account; `git push` uses
whatever credential helper is configured (`credential.helper=manager` on Windows, for
example), which can hold a stored credential for a different account — one with no write
access to the repo being pushed to.

**Symptom:** `git push` fails with
`remote: Permission to OWNER/REPO.git denied to <account>` /
`fatal: … 403`, while every `gh` command in the same session — `gh pr create`,
`gh issue create`, `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq .permissions` — succeeds, and
`gh auth status` shows green checkmarks. This is the trap: `gh auth status` reports token
*scope*, never push *reach*, and says nothing about which identity `git` itself will use.
A clean `gh auth status` does not mean the next `git push` will succeed.

**Diagnosis:** compare the identity `gh` is using against the identity `git`'s credential
helper will hand over. `git credential fill` prints the **full** credential record,
including a live token as `password=…` — never run it unfiltered where the output is
logged or captured; only the `username=` line is needed here. Its behavior also varies by
helper and, with no stored credential for the host, some helpers prompt interactively
(`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` makes that fail fast instead of hanging):

```bash
gh api user --jq .login
GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git credential fill <<< $'protocol=https\nhost=github.com\n' | grep '^username='
```

A mismatch is the defect. This is also why a reach preflight (`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO
--jq .permissions`, or `.permissions.push` to check write access specifically) is not
sufficient on its own: it only verifies `gh`'s identity, and reports healthy even when
this split is present, because it never touches the credential helper `git push` actually
uses.

**Per-push workaround** (no global config change, safe to run every time):

```bash
git -c credential.helper= -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push …
```

**Durable fix** (changes global git config — offer it, don't do it unasked): either
`gh auth setup-git`, or clear the stale credential-manager entry for `github.com` so it
stops resolving to the wrong account.

## Bumping a pinned plugin: the pin is not the registration

A repo that pins a plugin marketplace to an exact ref has **two** pieces of state, and only
one of them lives in the repo:

- the **pin** — `extraKnownMarketplaces.<marketplace>.source.ref` in `.claude/settings.json`,
  which is versioned and reviewed; and
- the **registration** — the same marketplace's entry in
  `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`, which is per-*user*, not per-project, and is
  what actually resolves at load time.

Editing the pin changes what is *declared*. It does not change what is *registered*, and
nothing reconciles the two on its own.

**Symptom:** `claude plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace> --scope project` reports
`already at the latest version (<old>)` right after the ref was edited to a newer tag —
success, no error, no change. `claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>` likewise
reports `Successfully updated` and leaves the registered ref alone. The session goes on
loading the old tag while every surface reports an enabled, healthy, correctly-pinned
plugin. Two further traps sit next to it: `claude plugin update` defaults to
`--scope user`, so on a project-scoped install it fails outright with *not installed at
scope user*; and if the marketplace was **first** registered without a `ref` at all — a
bare `/plugin marketplace add`, or a user-level `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry — that
registration wins permanently and a project-level pin has never once taken effect.

**What actually rotates the pin** — re-register the marketplace, then re-resolve the
install:

```bash
# 1. edit .claude/settings.json → extraKnownMarketplaces.<marketplace>.source.ref
claude plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>@<ref> --scope project
# the uninstall is load-bearing: a plain install short-circuits on "already installed"
claude plugin uninstall <plugin>@<marketplace> --scope project
claude plugin install   <plugin>@<marketplace> --scope project
# then restart — a running session keeps executing the copy it started with
```

**Verify by commit, never by version string.** The version is read from the plugin's
`plugin.json`, so it reports whatever that file said at the commit installed — which is
exactly right when the wrong commit is installed, and therefore proves nothing:

```bash
jq -r '.plugins["<plugin>@<marketplace>"][] | "\(.projectPath) \(.version) \(.gitCommitSha)"' \
  ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
git ls-remote --tags <marketplace-repo-url> <ref>
```

The two shas must be equal. A version string that matches while the shas differ is the
failure this section exists for, and it is silent in every other surface.

## Issue + label taxonomy

- **No title prefixes.** `[BUG] thing is broken` is noise — the label already says `bug`,
  and the prefix wastes the most scannable characters in the UI. Issue titles are plain
  imperative statements, same as a commit subject.
- **Labels carry structure on three orthogonal axes**, not one flat list. A label picked
  from each axis answers a different question, and mashing them together (the common
  failure) makes filtering useless:
  - **type** — `bug`, `feature`, `chore`, `docs`: what kind of work.
  - **`area/*`** — one per module boundary in *this* repo, using **the same vocabulary as
    its commit scopes**, so an issue and the commit that closes it are filterable by the
    same word. **Derive the list, never copy one.** In the engine these read `area/core`,
    `area/personas`, `area/tools`, `area/flows`, `area/ci`; in another repo they read
    whatever that repo's scopes read. `git log --format=%s | grep -oE '^[a-z]+\(([a-z-]+)\)'`
    is usually the whole answer. Copying a list from elsewhere creates labels for modules
    the repo does not have — which is worse than no area axis, because a label nobody can
    correctly apply gets applied incorrectly.
  - **`status/*`** — `status/blocked`, `status/needs-human`: where it is.
- **Machine-emitted labels stay namespaced under the emitting system** — the automation that
  writes the label, which is **not** reliably the repo it writes in. A repo that runs an
  engine of its own namespaces under the engine (`loop-engine/needs-human`, in a repo not
  called `loop-engine`); a repo whose only emitter *is* its own automation namespaces under
  itself (`bedrock-serverless-rag/needs-human`). "Namespace by repo" reproduces the second
  case correctly and the first case wrongly, which is why it survives as a mental model —
  and why this bullet states the rule as *the emitter*, twice, rather than trusting one
  example to carry it. This is the load-bearing rule: a namespace makes "did a human or a
  robot put this here?" answerable at a glance, without a separate identity for the machine.
  Never let an automated writer apply an un-namespaced label.

  **The exception is exactly where that rationale does not apply:** a bot that *has* its own
  identity — Dependabot posting as `dependabot[bot]`, applying the ecosystem-standard
  `dependencies` — already answers the question the namespace exists to answer. Namespacing
  those is churn that breaks the tooling's own conventions. The rule targets automation
  writing labels *as you*, which is the case a reader cannot otherwise detect.

## Prose economy — the deep record has a lifecycle

`/way-of-working:handoff` bounds the cursor; nothing bounds the deep record (`{roadmap}`,
a file-kind `{backlog}`) unless these rules do. An unbounded deep record is a standing
per-session token cost — every load-bearing doc is context some session must load — and
every hand-maintained claim in it is a future stale claim a critic round will be spent
correcting. The recurring defect class this section exists for: prose restating current
state that then drifts, and correction narratives accreting on top of corrections.

- **Derive, don't restate.** A fact a command can produce — a count, a list, a status, a
  live setting — is never hand-written into prose. Name the deriving command instead, or
  state nothing. A number in prose is a stale claim with a fuse. If several docs need the
  same figure, that is the signal to add the deriving command, not to copy the number.
- **One authoritative site per fact.** Every other mention points at it. Two statements of
  the same fact are a drift pair, and a critic finding one skewed corrects it by deleting
  the copy, not by synchronizing it.
- **Corrections replace text.** What was wrong and why belongs in the commit message and
  the PR — immutable, greppable — not inline. Strikethrough-and-annotate is reserved for a
  stale claim that still gates an open action, and it comes out once that action closes:
  an annotation that outlives its gate is text to delete, not history to keep.
- **Evidence, then prose — trust but verify.** A claim about live state records the
  command and the date it was read. A correction is re-verified as hard as the claim it
  replaces — fix rounds mint defects of their own, which is why
  `/way-of-working:critic-gate`'s convergence rule never stops on the round that applied
  fixes. A claim that cannot be evidenced is recorded as a risk the human accepts, not
  as fact.
- **The deep record is not append-only — it is compacted.** Resolved *or declined* backlog
  items and completed execution narrative belong in an archive file **beside the live
  record and tracked in git** — not
  under `.ai/`, whose archive holds git-ignored cursor snapshots and would drop the content
  at the next clone. Moving them is content-preserving — same text, same ID anchors — so
  existing citations still resolve by grep, and anything that reads the live record to
  learn what is already decided reads the archive alongside it. The live record holds:
  open items, locked decisions, whatever status table or index other tooling orients from,
  and a current-action section that fits on one screen — compaction moves *finished
  narrative*, never the surfaces a reader navigates by. Only a file-kind `{backlog}` has a
  derived archive path so far (`reference/project-schema.md`); for `{roadmap}` the
  destination is a per-repo choice until one is defined, so name it in the repo rather than
  inferring a convention that does not exist yet.
- **Write to the artifact's budget.** A decision is a decision-log entry stating the choice
  and why — not a narrative of how it was reached. A lesson that must survive is a rule in
  the relevant skill or convention, not a war story where it happened. And when the mistake
  a paragraph warns against has actually occurred, the durable form is a check that fails
  the same way the prose warns — a `{gates.green}` check, either a new entry or a new case
  inside one, verified by a deliberate regression — after which the paragraph shrinks to a
  pointer at the check. Where the class is worth blocking a merge rather than only a local
  run, promote it to CI as well: `{gates.green}` is a local pre-check, and CI on the PR is
  the gate of record. Promoting means all three, in order — a workflow job whose id is the
  check name, that name added to the repo's GitHub ruleset, and only then the name
  mirrored into `{ruleset.required_checks}`, which records GitHub's state rather than
  requesting it. Mirror it first and every later session reports the ruleset as weakened.
  Prose is the interim control for defects that have not yet earned a gate.

## Definition of Done
A unit of work is done only when: formatting + lint + the full test suite pass; new validated boundaries have negative-input tests; dependencies are pinned and CVE-clean with the SBOM regenerated; no unjustified `# noqa`; and no secrets in any committed file. For managed repos the repo's own `sprints/GLOBAL_DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` (if present) extends, never relaxes, this bar.

**A Definition of Done enumerates the unit's blocking preconditions, not only its
deliverables.** A DoD listing outcomes alone is how a precondition reaches a completion
review unaudited: the deliverables are all visibly shipped, so the unit reads as done while
the thing that was supposed to gate it was never checked.

### Blocking preconditions

A **blocking precondition** is something that must be true *before* a specific step may run
— a backup taken and verified restorable before a destructive migration, a snapshot copied
off-host before an irreversible transfer, a rollback path exercised before a one-way change.
It is not a deliverable. It gates one.

Two rules, and they are cheap:

- **Mark it.** In a sprint plan, prefix the criterion with the literal word **`BLOCKING:`**
  and name the step it gates. A convention that can be recognised mechanically is what lets a
  later check find every one of them without re-reading the plan for intent — and "read the
  plan and use judgment" is precisely what fails, because a satisfied criterion and a skipped
  one look identical in hindsight.

  ```markdown
  - BLOCKING: <state is copied out-of-band and verified restorable>
    — gates: <the first apply of this sprint, and again before Task 3>
  ```

- **Record its satisfaction where the work that relies on it lands.** A blocking precondition
  records its satisfaction **in the PR that relies on it** — one line naming what was done,
  when, and how it was verified. Evidence that lives in someone's memory has already failed
  for the next reader; six weeks later, "we definitely did that" is indistinguishable from
  "we definitely meant to."

**Prefer a precondition that can be evidenced.** A criterion whose satisfaction leaves no
artifact — no command output, no PR line, no tracked item — cannot be audited by anyone,
including its author. If it genuinely cannot be evidenced, say so in the plan and treat it as
a risk the human is accepting, not as a gate that was met.
