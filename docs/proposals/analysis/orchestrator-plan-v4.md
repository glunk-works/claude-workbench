# Sprint orchestrator for `way-of-working` — plan v4, with its review history

**Status:** proposal, nothing built, nothing filed. Untracked file; not part of any release.
**Written:** 2026-10-04, by a Claude Code session running Fable 5.1, for the maintainer of
`glunk-works/claude-workbench` and for a *separate* Claude session that will review this
document for context and bias.
**Revised:** 2026-10-04 (v4), by a second Fable 5.1 session that reviewed v3 against primary
sources and applied the corrections listed in § 6.3. The v4 reviser is the same model family as
the author; the next reviewer should not be.
**Supersedes:** plan v1, v2 and v3 (all summarised in § 6; none was filed).

---

## 0. How to review this document

You are reading this because the maintainer wants an independent check. The authoring
session had these properties, which a reviewer should treat as potential bias:

- It ran on **Fable 5.1**. Its eight critic and research subagents ran on Fable 5.1 (2), Opus 5.5 (2),
  the `claude-code-guide` agent (3), and a general web-research agent (1). No human reviewed
  any intermediate finding. Same-family judges are known to inflate agreement.
- It **selected which critic claims to verify**. Claims marked *verified by author* below were
  checked by the authoring session against the file or URL named. Claims marked *reported by
  subagent* were not independently re-read. Everything else is the author's own reasoning.
- The measured data (§ 3) comes from **local transcripts on one machine** and from GitHub PR
  metadata. The transcript scan de-duplicated one mirrored project directory; it did not
  reconcile against Anthropic's own usage accounting, which is not exposed to tools.
- The author produced v1, then argued against parts of v1 in v2 and v3. Watch for
  over-correction: v3 may be *more* conservative than the evidence requires in places § 7
  names.
- The author never ran a headless `claude -p` session, never ran a GitHub Action with the
  plugin, and never tested a hook under `--permission-prompts none`. All feasibility claims
  about those paths are from documentation.
- **v4 is a same-family revision.** The v3 reviewer (Fable 5.1) re-verified every § 2 row,
  re-ran `pr_analysis.py` and `daily_usage.py`, and fetched the § 4 URLs, but did not execute
  anything headless either. Its corrections are in § 6.3; claims it re-verified are marked
  **[R]** in § 4. Where v4 disagrees with v3's framing (§ 6.1, § 8.3), that is one reviewer's
  reading, not a settled fact.

Suggested checks for the reviewer:
1. Re-derive the § 3 PR counts from GitHub (`gh pr list --state all --limit 200 --json …`)
   for one repo and compare.
2. Re-read the four load-bearing repo claims in § 2 against the files named.
3. Spot-check three URLs in § 4, preferably the ones a step depends on
   (`--permission-prompts`, `setup-token`, hook fail-open behaviour).
4. Ask whether § 8.3's reframing of the "one wave per sitting" trade-off is itself fair, and
   whether § 6.1's softened verdict on v1's sprint branch now under-weights the evidence.
5. Ask whether anything in § 8 (open decisions) is actually the author's decision in disguise.
6. Check the § 6.3 corrections against the same primary sources; the reviser had no human
   check either.

## 1. The request and the constraint

**Request (2026-10-04).** The maintainer is the bottleneck for getting sprint work done
across several repos that consume the `way-of-working` plugin. They asked whether a
Fable-driven sprint/milestone orchestrator could direct subagent-based task execution to the
same quality bar without them dispatching each item, acknowledging it would change merge
rules and more. They then added two requirements and asked for repeated critical review:

- **Context management and token spend control are first-class design requirements.**
- **Everything must run on the maintainer's Claude subscription.** No API-key billing, no
  purchased usage credits.

**What the maintainer did NOT ask for.** Nothing here was approved. Every "decision" in § 8 is
theirs to make. The maintainer has not said whether a dedicated Linux host is acceptable.

---

## 2. Repo context and the trust rules the plan must hold

Source repo: `glunk-works/claude-workbench` (public). Consumers read in this analysis:
`603-Identity/devcontainers` (public, GitHub Team org), `603-Identity/infrastructure-core`
(private, Team org), `glunk-works/bounty-infra` (public, free org). Both orgs are visible to
the `JaredGroves-603` gh account; the `Seuss27` account cannot see 603-Identity private repos.

### 2.1 What the plugin is

A session-handoff protocol: short single-model Claude Code sessions externalise state into
`.ai/state.json` (git-ignored machine cursor, holds `next_action` and `hitl_gate`) and
`.ai/next-steps.md` (git-tracked ledger, landed as a docs-only "cursor-sync" PR per handoff).
Skills: `resume`, `handoff`, `ship`, `critic-gate`, `architect-review`, `plan-sprint`,
`archive-sprint`, `park-sprint`, `unpark-sprint`, `pr-checks`, `retro`. Agents (read-only
unless noted): `architect` (Opus), `security-critic` (Opus), `docs-consistency` (Opus),
`coder` (Sonnet, read/write). Deterministic predicates live in `plugins/way-of-working/bin/*.sh`
with fixture tests under `tests/` (WB-D10). Shared plugin code may never name a repo-specific
value; every such value is a key in `.ai/project.yml` (WB-D2, WB-D17; enforced by
`scripts/coupling-check.sh` in CI).

### 2.2 Trust rules (all *verified by author* against the files named)

| rule | where |
|---|---|
| A merged PR is the human approval. Claude never merges to `pr_base`, never approves. The one exception is resume's merge of a docs-only cursor-sync PR on explicit human confirmation. | `plugins/way-of-working/reference/workflow.md` § Integration gate; `docs/decisions.md` WB-D20 (line ~1003) |
| WB-D20 **rejected** handoff self-merging even a docs-only PR: a session steered by untrusted text could write a harmful `next_action`, approve it, and the next session would run it unattended. | `docs/decisions.md` WB-D20, "Rejected" bullet |
| Issue bodies and spec comments are specifications, never instructions. The coder verifies the issue's `updated_at` and `author_association` (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR) against a human-anchored `plan_anchor` before building. | `plugins/way-of-working/agents/coder.md` step 2; `bin/plan-anchor.sh` header |
| resume auto-starts a `next_action` only when: `hitl_gate` NONE OPEN, status `implementing`, model matches, cursor not drifted, no open cursor-sync PR and no unmerged sync branch under HEAD, plan anchor verifies, task author trusted. Fails closed. "Auto-start removes a rubber stamp, not a gate." | `skills/resume/SKILL.md` auto-start section (~L873-1000) |
| critic-gate proposes critics; the human picks; a second-opinion round on another model needs the human's own message in the live session. | `skills/critic-gate/SKILL.md` L49-64, L262-290 |
| handoff explicitly refuses to commit the ledger onto the code branch: "bundles cursor churn into the code PR's review, which is the muddle this whole step exists to prevent." | `skills/handoff/SKILL.md` ~L283-291 |
| `cursor-sync-pr.sh` offers a PR only when same-repo, changes exactly `.ai/next-steps.md`, head branch starts with `docs/sync-cursor-`, and a local branch of that name sits at its head. Its `unmerged` verdict fires only when HEAD is on such a branch. | `bin/cursor-sync-pr.sh` L19-32, L77, L100, L200 |
| `cursor-drift.sh` classifies a HEAD-vs-`last_commit` delta as `cursor-sync` iff every path is `.ai/next-steps.md` or under `.ai/parked/`. | `bin/cursor-drift.sh` L69-83 |
| `review-sandbox.sh trust` → `trusted=1` only for OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR **and** same-repo head. An untrusted PR gets no local execution. | `bin/review-sandbox.sh` L183-185, L324 |
| Branch ruleset on `main` (this repo): deletion, non-fast-forward, pull_request (0 required reviewers), required checks `lint`, `coupling`, `invariants`. No bypass actors. | `gh api repos/glunk-works/claude-workbench/rulesets/19562210` |

### 2.3 devcontainers specifics (the consumer with the fresh-session review gate)

*Verified by author* unless noted.

- `review.ci_gate.check: architect-review` is a **required status**. The gate workflow
  (`.github/workflows/architect-review-gate.yml`) counts a review comment only when its
  author's numeric user ID is in `REVIEWER_IDS: "281693088"` (the owner), and posts the status
  against the PR head SHA. Triggers: `pull_request` (opened/synchronize/reopened),
  `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`. Its own header notes that `pull_request*` runs use the
  PR's **own copy** of the workflow (issue #93).
- Open decisions on that gate: **#93** (a same-repo PR can edit the gate it is checked by) and
  **#122** (review-gate trust model, F9b: any writer can mint the status from their own PR
  workflow; decide before auto-merge is turned on). devcontainers' own ledger commits the owner
  to deciding both by **2026-10-17**; on GitHub both sit in the milestone *Repo hardening:
  review gate and CI*, due **2026-12-15**. The earlier date is a ledger promise, not a GitHub
  deadline. **#139** (turn on auto-merge for verified image bumps) is gated on #122.
- `.ai/project.yml` `code_paths` includes `.ai/project.yml`, `.claude/`, `tests/`, `tools/`,
  `.github/`, `.trivyignore.yaml`, `.gitattributes` — with comments saying an edit weakening
  any of them must route to review.
- `.claude/settings.json`: deny rules cover only `git push --force*`, `git push -f`,
  `git commit --no-verify`, `-n`, `git push --no-verify`. One PreToolUse hook:
  `bash "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/merge-guard.sh"` on Bash|PowerShell.
- `merge-guard.sh` blocks command segments starting with `gh pr merge` except resume's exact
  cursor-sync shape; its own comments list residuals: `python -c`, `xargs`, and "if this script
  cannot run at all (no bash), the call is not blocked. The main ruleset still requires every
  check." A merge via `gh api -X PUT repos/…/pulls/N/merge` is **not** matched.
- Ruleset `main-required-checks`: pull_request + required_status_checks. Required checks
  include `architect-review` and `selftest`.

## 3. The measured problem

### 3.1 Where the human's time goes (GitHub PR metadata, *verified by author*)

Classification by PR title prefix: `docs(cursor)`/`docs: sync cursor`/park/anchor → **cursor**;
`docs: mark`/`docs(roadmap|sprint|decisions|ledger)`/`chore(release|claude|ai)` → **record**;
dependabot; everything else → **work**. Script: `pr_analysis.py` (see § 10).

| repo | window | work PRs | cursor PRs | record PRs | cursor per work | median open→merge (work) | median work PR size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| devcontainers | 2026-09-28 → 10-04 | 55 (53 merged) | 81 (68 merged) | 7 | **1.53** | 15 min | 64 lines |
| infrastructure-core | 2026-08-14 → 10-01 | 84 | 48 | 63 | 0.57 | 11 min | 166 lines |
| claude-workbench | 2026-07-22 → 10-02 | 71 | 52 | 31 | 0.73 | 12 min | 129 lines |

Busiest day, devcontainers (2026-10-02): **31 merges over 11.3 h, median 9 min between
merges**, 13 of them work. infrastructure-core 2026-09-07: 29 merges over 22.8 h.

One issue end to end (devcontainers #160, a +4/−1 fix): PR 237 cursor → PR 238 code →
PR 239 cursor "shipped; architect review next" → PR 241 cursor "reviewed and merged". Three
PRs, three sessions (coder, handoff, fresh-session reviewer), ~9 human touches, 25 minutes.
**14 cursor PRs in the last 200 exist only to say "architect review next"** (title match on
"review next"; v3 said 16 without a reproducible rule).

Sprint 7 on this repo (PRs #200–#208): 9 PRs for 2 issues (#162, #189), 7 of them ceremony.
v3 said 11; the extra two were sprint-06 close-out PRs.

Decision backlog the loop cannot clear: devcontainers' ledger lists 4 owner-owned items;
infrastructure-core has 15 open issues labelled `status/needs-human` (13) or `decision` (8),
counted 2026-10-04 (v3 said 10).

Where the human-time baseline actually sits: today's flow is already **one task per human
merge**, with 9–15 minutes between merges on a busy day, and dependent tasks already wait on
that merge. Any design that keeps the human merge as the approval inherits this cadence; the
question each design answers is how many *independent* tasks can be ready at each merge, and
how much reading each merge demands. Neither the cursor-PR count nor the touch count measures
reading time; nothing in this document does.

Host friction recorded in devcontainers' own ledger: `GH_TOKEN` per repo (two gh accounts),
commits from Windows but tests in WSL, auto mode blocks ruleset edits, host GPG cache TTL
for long sessions.

### 3.2 Where the tokens go (local transcripts, *verified by author*, scripts in § 10)

`~/.claude/projects/<proj>/*.jsonl`; each `assistant` line carries `message.usage`.
Subagent transcripts live under `<proj>/<session>/subagents/`. The
`personal-claude-workbench` directory mirrors the `glunk-works-claude-workbench` one
(identical session files) and was excluded.

Since 2026-09-01 (272 main sessions, 848 subagent files):

| measure | value |
|---|---|
| cache-read tokens, main sessions | ≈ 2.3 B |
| cache-read tokens, subagents (critics) | ≈ 0.6 B, almost all Opus (654 of 848 files Opus 5.5, 156 Opus 5) |
| cache writes + output, all | < 0.13 B |
| median peak context per session | 138 k |
| sessions whose peak context passed 150 k | 142 of 325 |
| share of all cache reads on turns above 150 k context | **79 %** |
| five largest sessions | claude-workbench coder sessions 2026-09-23..25, 200–480 turns, 350–505 k median context, Sonnet 5 (1 M window) |
| plugin prose loaded per session (resume+handoff+ship+critic-gate+conventions) | ≈ 169 KB ≈ 42 k tokens |

Daily envelope, last 14 days (de-duplicated): mean **≈ 195 M cache-read/day**, 0.9 M
output/day, ≈ 52 sessions/day (incl. ≈ 34 Opus critic subagents/day). Opus ≈ 60 M/day of
cache reads, Sonnet ≈ 124 M, Fable ≈ 10 M. Per-session medians: main Sonnet 5.1 M cache-read
/ 49 turns (p90 47.5 M); main Opus 2.6 M / 29 turns; Opus critic subagent 0.2 M / 10 turns.

Reading: spend is dominated by re-reading large contexts; four-fifths of it happens in
sessions past 150 k. A capped task session (≈100 k context, ≤60 turns) is about one of today's
median Sonnet sessions, so a wave of four tasks ≈ one current afternoon.

**These are API-token figures used as a proxy.** Under the subscription constraint the binding
quantity is consumption of the 5-hour and weekly windows, which Anthropic does not expose as a
number. Cache-read tokens track that consumption in direction (a long-context turn costs more
of the window than a short one) but not in units, and `--max-budget-usd` is a list-price
estimate of the same proxy. The governor in § 7.4 is sized on the proxy and must be re-sized
from observed limit errors once anything runs.

## 4. Platform facts the plan depends on

Legend: **[A]** verified by author from the URL on 2026-10-04; **[S]** reported by a subagent
with the URL, not re-read by the author; **[R]** re-verified by the v3 reviewer from the URL
on 2026-10-04 (a claim marked [A][R] was read twice; one marked [S][R] was first read by the
reviewer).

### 4.1 Headless and budgets (`claude -p`)
- `--max-budget-usd` exists, print mode only, subagent spend counts, spawning stops at the cap;
  it is a **client-side list-price estimate**. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference.md
- `--max-turns` (exits with error at the limit), `--json-schema` (structured output in
  `structured_output`), `--autocompact <100k..1M>` (per-launch auto-compact window, capped at
  the model's window), `--fork-session`, `--forward-subagent-text`, `--plugin-dir`,
  `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`, `--restricted`, `--setting-sources`,
  `--settings`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--append-subagent-system-prompt`. [A] same URL
- `--permission-prompts none` removes tools that need a person (AskUserQuestion) and denies
  anything that would prompt **"unless a `PermissionRequest` hook allows it"**. **Requires
  v2.1.259+.** `dontAsk` mode also denies AskUserQuestion. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless.md
- **Installed CLI on the maintainer's machine is 2.1.228** (`claude --version`). The version
  floor comes from headless.md, not from `--help`: cli-reference.md says `--help` does not list
  every flag, so a flag's absence there proves nothing. [A][R]
- `--bare` skips hooks/skills/plugins/CLAUDE.md **and never reads OAuth credentials or
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`**; it needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. So bare mode is out under the
  subscription constraint. [A][R] headless.md; authentication.md
- Plain `-p` without `--bare` runs the project's hooks and connects its `.mcp.json` servers
  "even in a folder you've never trusted", with no trust dialog. [A][R] headless.md
- `--output-format json` includes `total_cost_usd`, per-model usage, `permission_denials`. [A]
- Background subagents hold a `-p` process open up to 10 min idle by default
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS`). [A]

### 4.2 Subagents, hooks, settings
- Subagents **can** spawn subagents, default 3 levels (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH`).
  `isolation: worktree` is a documented frontmatter field. Subagent requests count toward the
  same usage limits. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md
  → The sentence "a subagent cannot spawn subagents" at `reference/workflow.md` L140 is
  **stale**. [A][R] v3 said the same sentence was also in `skills/critic-gate/SKILL.md`; it is
  not (no "spawn", "nest" or "sibling" phrasing there). [R]
- Project hooks are picked up by a file watcher when settings change mid-session (not
  snapshotted). A missing/non-executable hook, a timed-out hook, and any exit code other than
  0 or 2 are **non-blocking: the action proceeds** ("for most hook events"). Managed-settings
  hooks cannot be disabled from user/project/local settings. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md
- **`PermissionRequest` hooks are an allow path under `--permission-prompts none`.** v3 said
  they "can deny, not allow"; that was inverted. headless.md: "Anything that would prompt is
  denied unless a `PermissionRequest` hook allows it." hooks.md adds that exit code 2 is not
  honoured for this event and the decision goes through the `decision` object. Consequence for
  § 7.3: any settings source the session loads can *widen* permissions through such a hook, so
  the driver must own every settings source the session sees, not only the deny rules. [R]
- Deny rules win over allow rules and over `bypassPermissions`. [S] permissions.md

### 4.3 Subscription authentication and limits
- `claude setup-token` mints a **one-year** OAuth token, subscription-billed, Pro/Max/Team/
  Enterprise, "can only make model requests" (no Remote Control, no claude.ai connectors). No
  revocation procedure is documented. Deleting a GitHub Actions secret does not invalidate the
  credential it held. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication.md ;
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions.md (Uninstall)
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` gives each login its own credentials/settings directory. [A][R] authentication.md
- Subscription usage: rolling **5-hour** window plus a **weekly** window, shared across all
  models (plus model-specific Opus/Sonnet limits). Subagents, background sessions, routines,
  `-p` runs and `/insights` all draw from the same pool. Without usage credits, further runs
  are rejected until the window resets. `autoContinueAtUsageLimit` exists for interactive
  sessions. [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs.md
- Prompt cache TTL: **1 h** for the main conversation on subscription within plan usage,
  **5 min** on usage credits and for subagents/workflows by default. `/usage` shows hit ratio
  (main conversation only). [A] costs.md; [S] prompt-caching.md
- `/usage` plan breakdown attributes usage to skills, subagents, plugins, MCP servers, and
  flags long-context/cache-miss behaviours ≥10 %. Computed from local history. [A] costs.md
- A `-p` run that hits the limit exits with an error. [S] errors.md, headless.md
- **Agent SDK is API-key only**: "Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third
  party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents
  built on the Claude Agent SDK." [S][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview.md
- Auto mode is available on subscription, in `-p`, on Sonnet 5.5 / Opus 5.5 / Fable 5.1 /
  Opus 4.7+. [S] auto-mode-config.md
- No documented terms statement restricting subscription use to interactive sessions; the
  reviewer should check https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms. [S]

### 4.4 GitHub Action, routines, merge queue
- `anthropics/claude-code-action`: accepts `claude_code_oauth_token`; automation mode runs on
  any event when `prompt` is set; on issue/PR events the triggering user must have write
  access; bot actors rejected unless `allowed_bots`; **commits pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do
  not trigger CI**; inputs `plugins`, `plugin_marketplaces`, `claude_args`, `settings`.
  [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions.md
  The docs do **not** say the Action cannot merge or approve (v3 claimed that). The Claude
  GitHub App holds *Contents: read and write* and *Pull requests: read and write*, which is
  enough to merge through the API; only the tool allowlist in `claude_args` prevents it.
  Treat "cannot merge" as a configuration property, never an identity property. [R]
- Its security doc restores a **fixed list** from the PR base branch before running:
  `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude.json`, `.gitmodules`, `.ripgreprc`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.husky/`; base-absent paths are removed and PR versions kept under
  `.claude-pr/`. It sanitises HTML comments, invisible characters, image alt text, hidden
  attributes and entities; scrubs Anthropic/cloud/GitHub secrets from subprocess env (best
  effort; bubblewrap PID isolation on Linux); warns "Do not check out an untrusted ref into
  the workspace root" and "Do not use a personal access token". [S][R]
  https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md
- Routines: research preview; subscription usage; commits and PRs **carry the maintainer's
  GitHub user**; push to `claude/` branches; GitHub triggers cover **pull_request and release
  only** (not issues); API trigger exists; hourly caps (100 scheduled/h per account, 30 API
  fires/h per routine). [A][R] https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines.md
- Merge queue: public org repos, or private repos on Enterprise Cloud; **not** private repos
  on Team. [S] docs.github.com + community discussion. **Unverified either way:** the cited
  docs.github.com page, fetched twice by the v3 reviewer, contains no availability statement.
  If true → available for claude-workbench, devcontainers, bounty-infra; not
  infrastructure-core. [A][R] repo visibility via `gh api`
- 603-Identity is on GitHub **Team**; glunk-works has no paid plan. [A][R] `gh api orgs/…`

## 5. Design principles (unchanged from v3)

1. **The orchestrator never merges to `pr_base`.** Every approval that lands on main is a
   human merge of a task-sized PR. No sprint branch, no driver merges anywhere.
2. **The human's merge is the only approval, as a property of credentials, not prose.** The
   loop's GitHub identity cannot merge, cannot post commit statuses, cannot push to `main`,
   has no admin. Hooks and deny rules are defence in depth, never the control.
3. **Deterministic driver** (fixture-tested `bin/` scripts, WB-D10). LLM judgment only in
   named slots with `--json-schema` output: classify a stop. Nothing else.
4. **One fresh capped session per task.** `claude -p` on the subscription login with
   `--max-turns`, `--max-budget-usd` (as a proxy), `--autocompact ≤ 100k`,
   `--permission-prompts none`, a narrow `--allowedTools` list. Justified by § 3.2 (context
   spend), *not* by subagent nesting.
5. **Policy resolved before the session, by the driver, from existing predicates**
   (`plan-anchor.sh` per task at dispatch, `review-base-anchor.sh`, `spawn-model.sh`,
   `cursor-drift.sh`). The interactive skills stay interactive; the session gets a narrow task
   prompt. One WB-D names which human authorizations become plan-time policy.
6. **The session's own configuration is driver-owned.** Config dir, `--settings`,
   `--plugin-dir` (pinned copy), managed-settings hooks on the host; config paths restored from
   `origin/{pr_base}` before every launch; hashes checked.
7. **Plan-then-execute.** The step set and writable locations are fixed before any session
   reads issue text. Only human-anchored issues by trusted authors are dispatched (existing
   stop). No quarantined-extraction layer (see § 7).
8. **Human-only paths** are a schema key (`orchestration.human_only_paths`, WB-D17 style:
   present, explicit). Enforced twice: in-session deny rules supplied by the driver, and a
   post-exit `git diff --name-only origin/{pr_base}...head` check. Either failing stops the
   wave.
9. **Author ≠ approver ≠ gate-minter.** No identity the loop controls is ever in a review
   gate's reviewer allowlist.
10. **Budgets are subscription-usage budgets**, sized from § 3.2 and enforced by the driver:
    per-day session cap, human-hours window, Opus/Fable quotas from policy, Sonnet critics by
    default, transcript-metered token ceiling, stop on any limit error.
11. **Evidence over assertion.** Digest derived mechanically by the driver (files, tests
    added, critic rounds and stop reason, usage, hook denials), mirrored into the PR body by the
    driver's identity. Per-task audit line in an append-only log outside any worktree.
12. **Fixture on `bin/` change.** A task touching `plugins/*/bin` or `scripts/` must add or
    change a fixture; the driver checks the diff.

## 6. Review history (what was wrong with v1, v2 and v3, and what survived)

### 6.1 v1 (first draft) — key shape and why it fell
Phases: sprint-branch mode (task PRs merged by a session into an unprotected `sprint/NN`
branch, one human merge per sprint) → headless-safe skills (declared headless outcome per
AskUserQuestion site, whole-build-order anchor, bot identity) → `bin/run-sprint.sh` → move
off the Windows host.

Findings against it (three of four v1 reviewers converged, per the author; the v3 reviewer did
not open their reports and re-verified the facts instead):
- **Sprint branch re-opens WB-D20 through config, not the cursor.** Task 2 boots from the
  tree task 1 wrote; on devcontainers that tree includes `.ai/project.yml` (`gates.green` is
  arbitrary shell), `.claude/`, the merge-guard hook, `CLAUDE.md`, the gate workflow. The human
  read moved to the end of the batch. *Verified by author and by the v3 reviewer* that
  devcontainers lists those paths in `code_paths` for exactly this reason.
  **v4 note:** § 7.3's per-launch restore of configuration from the *protected* branch answers
  this objection for a sprint branch as well, if the restore source is `origin/main` rather
  than the sprint branch. v3 adopted the restore and did not re-weigh v1 against it. What
  survives against the sprint branch after the restore: (a) **review granularity** — one
  fresh-session review of a sprint-sized diff instead of 64-line PRs, on a repo whose gate
  counts per-PR reviews on `main`; (b) **task N builds on task N−1's unreviewed code**, which
  v1 itself listed under "Known risks"; (c) a driver that merges anywhere violates principle 1
  by letter. These are real costs but they are costs of *review quality*, not a WB-D20 breach.
  The v1 verdict therefore stands on evidence, but § 6.1 as written in v3 overstated it.
- **Driver-dispatched coder + reviewer empties the fresh-session gate.** The gate counts the
  owner's ID; a headless reviewer under the owner's login mints it by construction. Per-task
  reviews into an unprotected branch satisfy nothing on main. *Verified by author.*
- **Bot identity breaks the plugin's trust predicates** (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR allowlist)
  or becomes a trusted writer — the #122 question. *Verified by author.*
- **"Declared headless outcome per ask site" converts human authorizations into config.**
- **Whole-build-order anchor = batch-wide stall** on any issue comment. *Verified by author.*
- **Stale premises:** subagents can nest; budget flags already exist. *Verified by author.*
- Nothing on crash/resume, concurrency with the one live cursor, kill switch, audit.

Survived into v2: deterministic driver, fresh capped session per task, policy before session,
anchor per task, human-only paths, derived digest, usage governor, eval set, context diet.

### 6.2 v2 — key shape and why it was reshaped again
Steps: ledger written into the open task PR → close-time fixes → event-dispatched fresh review
under a non-counting identity → context diet → headless coder loop after #93/#122 → ops.

Findings (three reviewers; each marked with what the author verified):
1. **Ledger-in-task-PR re-opens the WB-D20 gap wider.** `cursor-sync-pr.sh` is blind to a
   task branch (prefix filter), so resume sees `cursor-sync` drift, "none" for sync PRs, gate
   NONE OPEN → **auto-start of a `next_action` nobody merged**. The human merging on GitHub
   approves the ledger's **Next:**, never the git-ignored `next_action`; WB-D20's only display
   of `next_action` is resume's offer path, which this makes dead. handoff's prose explicitly
   rejects the shape. *All verified by author* (§ 2.2 rows 6–8).
2. **Event-dispatched review cannot satisfy the gate and leaks the token.** A bot's review is
   skipped by `REVIEWER_IDS`; a routine runs as the owner and *would* count, violating
   principle 9. `ready_for_review`/`labeled` are `pull_request` activity types that run the
   PR's own workflow copy **with repository secrets**, so a task PR can edit the workflow and
   print `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. *Gate allowlist and workflow-copy note verified by
   author; secrets-on-same-repo-PR is GitHub semantics (reported).*
3. **Session config comes from the task branch's working tree**, and hooks reload live and
   fail open. Driver-side "read from origin/pr_base" does not reach the session. *Verified by
   author* (§ 4.2).
4. **Hooks are tripwires.** Deny rules and merge-guard do not see `gh api … /merge`,
   `python -c`, aliases. *Verified by author* (§ 2.3).
5. **Budgets unbounded on subscription.** `--max-budget-usd` is a list-price estimate blind
   to the pool. No pre-dispatch usage read is documented beyond status-line fields. *Verified
   by author.*
6. **Throughput honesty.** Dependent tasks wait on the human's merge to main, so v2 runs one
   task (or one independent wave) per sitting. v1 bought N tasks per sitting at the cost of a
   sprint-sized PR and the config gap above.
7. **Acceptance-test-first and quarantined extraction are theatre for this repo class**
   (median PR edits SKILL.md prose; the anchored trusted-author issue already is the boundary).
8. **Human-only path set incomplete** (misses `tests/`, `.gitattributes`, `.trivyignore.yaml`,
   `scripts/`, `plugins/*/{bin,hooks}`). *Verified against devcontainers' `code_paths`.*
9. Housekeeping: CLI is 2.1.228 (flag needs 2.1.259); stale nesting sentence at
   `workflow.md` L140; merge queue only on the public repos.

Placement analysis under the subscription constraint (security reviewer, author agrees):

| placement | model auth | GitHub identity | secret at rest | assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| local Windows host | maintainer's login | maintainer's admin `gh`, cached GPG | none new | worst: owner credentials for two orgs, hooks fail open, MSYS quirks |
| cloud routine | subscription | **the maintainer** | none | acts as the owner, so it can mint the gate; PR/release triggers only |
| GitHub Action | `setup-token` secret | Claude App (short-lived token) | one-year OAuth token | only placement with a separate GitHub identity; a leak costs usage for a year, not repos; same-repo PR triggers expose the secret |
| dedicated Linux host / VM running the devcontainers image | `setup-token` in its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | fine-grained PAT, non-owner, one repo, no admin/statuses | token on a host the maintainer controls | best for the coder loop: root-owned managed hooks the branch cannot disable; no GPG; egress limited |
| **WSL2 distro on the existing machine** (added in v4; not assessed by the v2 reviewers) | `setup-token` in its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` inside the distro | machine user's PAT in its own `GH_CONFIG_DIR`; the maintainer's `gh` and GPG never enter the distro | token on the maintainer's laptop, inside the distro | most of the Linux-host row's properties without new hardware: root-owned managed settings, no MSYS, egress via Windows firewall rules; weaker isolation (shared kernel host, laptop sleep interrupts runs, same physical machine as the admin credentials) |

### 6.3 v3 — what the v3 review corrected (applied in v4)

The v3 reviewer (a second Fable 5.1 session, 2026-10-04) verified against the repo, the
consuming repos over read-only `gh api`, the cited URLs, and re-ran `pr_analysis.py` and
`daily_usage.py`. Every § 2.2 row, § 2.3 fact, § 3 number marked *verified by author*, and
§ 4 claim marked [A] reproduced, except the items below. The reviewer did not open
`analysis/session-export/`.

Wrong in v3, fixed in v4:
1. § 4.2 said `PermissionRequest` hooks "can deny, not allow" under `--permission-prompts
   none`. headless.md says the opposite. Fixed in § 4.2; consequence added to § 7.3.
2. § 7.3 called `.claude CLAUDE.md .mcp.json .ai/project.yml` "the Action's restore list". The
   Action's list also has `.husky/` (git hooks that execute on the loop host's own commit),
   `.gitmodules`, `.claude.json`, `.ripgreprc`, `CLAUDE.local.md`. Fixed in § 7.3.
3. § 4.2 and step 2 said the stale nesting sentence is also in `critic-gate/SKILL.md`. It is
   only in `workflow.md` L140. Fixed in both places.

Overstated or unsupported in v3, corrected in v4:
4. "16 cursor PRs … architect review next" → 14 by a stated rule (§ 3.1).
5. "Sprint 7: 11 PRs for 2 issues" → 9 PRs, #200–#208 (§ 3.1).
6. infrastructure-core "10" decision issues → 15 on 2026-10-04 (§ 3.1).
7. "#93/#122 due 2026-10-17" is a ledger promise; the GitHub milestone is due 2026-12-15 (§ 2.3, § 8.1).
8. "No merge/approve capability" for the Action is not in the docs and is false as an identity
   property (§ 4.4).
9. Merge-queue plan availability is unverified from the cited page (§ 4.4).
10. The `--help` grep was not evidence for the `--permission-prompts` version floor (§ 4.1).

Framing the v3 reviewer disputed, reworded in v4 (one reviewer's reading, flagged as such):
11. § 6.1's "killed it" overstated the sprint-branch case once § 7.3's restore existed (note
    added in § 6.1).
12. § 8.3 presented one-wave-per-sitting as a ceiling to "accept"; it is today's cadence
    (§ 3.1 baseline paragraph, § 8.3 rewritten).
13. Step 1's trust surface was "none"; it changes what the merged ledger records, so the WB-D
    now covers step 1 as well as step 4 (§ 7.1).
14. § 8.2 offered only host-or-nothing; a WSL2 row was added to the placement table and § 8.2.
15. § 8.5 re-opened the maintainer's stated hard constraint; moved to § 9 as a note.
16. § 3.2's token figures were not named as a proxy for window consumption; paragraph added.
17. Step 4 assumed "independent tasks" are derivable from plan-sprint's build order; plan-sprint
    emits a numbered sequence with no independence marker (`skills/plan-sprint/SKILL.md`
    L303). Dependency added to step 4 and § 7.3.

Biases the v3 reviewer named that v3 had not declared: API-token cost framing under a
subscription constraint; exit metrics that count touches, not reading time; a security posture
tuned to prompt injection over review-load; "trust surface: none" on the author's own
ceremony fix.

## 7. The plan (v4)

### 7.1 Steps

| # | change | trust surface | exit metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **No-op handoff rule.** When the only cursor change is "review or merge PR N next", handoff writes `.ai/state.json` and skips the ledger PR; resume derives that step from GitHub state (open PR by this session for the task issue). Fix #209 (roadmap entry written before close) and #220 (dirty ledger) so a sprint close is one PR. | **small, and it needs the WB-D**: `main`'s ledger stops being the complete record during a review (WB-D20's display property), and resume gains a GitHub-derived step. The WB-D must say what a fresh machine with no `state.json` does. | cursor PRs per work PR < 0.5 on devcontainers within one week; relay PRs = 0; plus **minutes the human spends per work PR**, measured from merge timestamps, so reading load is visible |
| 2 | Fix the stale nesting sentence (`workflow.md` L140 only). Split `resume` into a lean auto-start path plus on-demand appendices (target < 20 k tokens of plugin prose per task session). Update the CLI to ≥ 2.1.259 on the host that will run anything headless. | none | prose loaded per task session measured from transcripts |
| 3 | **Fresh-session review stays human-started**, locally, as today (after step 1 it costs one session and zero PRs). Automating it is **blocked on #122 and #93**. If and when they are decided: `workflow_dispatch` from the driver only, no `pull_request*` trigger, no PR checkout, the OAuth secret in a GitHub Environment with required reviewers, tools limited to read + inline-comment, `--max-turns`, `timeout-minutes`, concurrency group. Posted under an identity **not** in any reviewer allowlist. | blocked | n/a |
| 4 | **Headless coder loop** (`bin/run-sprint.sh`, fixture-tested) on a Linux host, VM, or WSL2 distro (§ 8.2) running the devcontainers image. Details in 7.2–7.5. Waves of **independent** tasks; task PRs to `pr_base`; the human merges the wave in one sitting (merge queue where available; serial CI re-runs on infrastructure-core). **Prerequisite not in the plugin today:** plan-sprint emits a numbered build order with no independence marker, so either plan-sprint gains a per-issue `depends_on` (human-confirmed at planning, like the build-order slot) or the driver treats the whole order as one chain and dispatches one task per sitting. | **the same WB-D** (which human authorizations become plan-time policy; the loop identity's trust class; the human-only path key; the independence marker) | a 3–4 task wave completes with no session above the context cap and spend under the ceiling; zero human touches between dispatch and the merge sitting; **and** human minutes per work PR not above the step-1 baseline |
| 5 | **Usage governor and operations** (7.4, 7.5). | none | no "hit your limit" error during the maintainer's declared hours over two weeks |
| 6 | **Eval set**: 20–50 real past tasks (from merged PRs), code-graded first, re-run per driver release; read the transcripts. | none | pass^k stable release over release |

Steps 1–2 are one milestone (five issues, the stale-sentence fix, and the WB-D's step-1 half).
Steps 4–6 are a second milestone that cannot start before the human decisions in § 8.

### 7.2 Step 4 — identities and credentials
- Model auth: `claude setup-token` minted by the maintainer, stored only on the loop host in
  its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Rotate yearly; record the mint date.
- GitHub: a **separate machine user** (or an App, once #122 decides its trust class) with a
  fine-grained PAT scoped to the one repo: contents + pull-requests write, **no** admin,
  **no** statuses, **no** workflow-file permission. Own `GH_CONFIG_DIR`.
- Allowed git/gh surface for the session: `git push origin task/*`, `gh pr create`, read
  calls. Everything else denied by `--allowedTools` + driver-supplied deny rules.
- Commits unsigned or SSH-signed with the machine identity, never the maintainer's GPG key
  (WB-D20: signature is not an authorship signal; a distinguishable committer is).
- Egress on the host limited to Anthropic and GitHub.

### 7.3 Step 4 — session configuration
- Own clone per task (never the maintainer's checkout; WB-D12 single live cursor holds).
- Before each launch, restore from `origin/{pr_base}` **the Action's full list plus this
  plugin's own config**: `.claude/ .mcp.json .claude.json .gitmodules .ripgreprc CLAUDE.md
  CLAUDE.local.md .husky/ .ai/project.yml`; remove any of them the base lacks (as the Action
  does); then hash-compare hook and settings blobs against `origin/{pr_base}`. Run git for the
  session with `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` (or a driver-owned empty hooks dir) so neither
  `.husky/` nor a task-branch `.git/hooks` write can execute on commit.
- Launch: `claude -p --model sonnet --max-turns N --max-budget-usd X --autocompact 100k
  --permission-mode dontAsk --permission-prompts none --allowedTools "…" --settings
  <driver-file> --setting-sources user --plugin-dir <pinned copy> --strict-mcp-config
  --output-format json --json-schema <stop-schema> "<task prompt>"`.
  Whether `--setting-sources user` suppresses project `CLAUDE.md` is **unverified**; if not,
  the restore step covers it.
- **Every settings source the session loads is driver-owned**, because a `PermissionRequest`
  hook in any loaded source can *allow* what `--permission-prompts none` would deny (§ 4.2).
  Concretely: the user settings in the loop's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` are written by the driver,
  the `--settings` file is the driver's, `--setting-sources user` excludes project/local, and
  the restore step above neutralises `.claude/` anyway. The post-exit audit line records the
  hash of each.
- Host-level: root-owned `managed-settings.json` carrying the deny rules and PreToolUse
  guards, so a branch cannot disable them. Verify on the chosen distro (and inside WSL2 if
  § 8.2 lands there).
- Wave composition comes from the plan, not from the driver's guess: a task is dispatched in
  the same wave as another only when the human-confirmed plan marks neither as depending on
  the other (step 4's prerequisite). Absent the marker, one task per sitting.
- Task prompt: the anchored issue number, the spec comment id, acceptance criteria, target
  files, the gate command list from `origin/{pr_base}`'s `.ai/project.yml`. Never raw issue
  text beyond that.

### 7.4 Step 4/5 — the usage governor
Implementable from docs: per-task `--max-turns`, `--max-budget-usd` (proxy), `--autocompact`;
`--model sonnet` default with Opus/Fable only when the human-authored policy names them;
`timeout` around every session; parse `permission_denials`, `total_cost_usd`, `is_error`
from the result JSON; stop on any "hit your limit" result.

Driver-side rules (sized from § 3.2):
- per-day session cap and per-day Opus/Fable session cap;
- dispatch only inside a declared window (e.g. 00:00–07:00 local) plus marked away-blocks;
- reserve ≥ 50 % of the measured weekly envelope for the maintainer's interactive work;
- transcript-metered token ceiling per task and per day (sum `cache_read` + `output`);
- liveness: transcript mtime; a session silent > N minutes is killed and recorded;
- backoff and stop after the first limit error; never auto-continue.

Not implementable from docs: a reliable pre-dispatch read of remaining plan usage.

### 7.5 Step 5 — state, recovery, audit
- Driver state: append-only JSONL **outside any worktree**, owned by the driver user. GitHub
  is the source of truth, reconciled at each step (`git ls-remote` for the branch, `gh pr list
  --head` for the PR, digest marker in the PR body).
- Recovery: pushed-but-no-PR → create the PR without re-running; PR-but-no-digest → write it
  from the log.
- Kill file outside any worktree, checked before each dispatch and polled during a run (kill
  the process group). Lock file in the driver directory; `resume` refuses auto-start while
  present (needs a small plugin change).
- Per-task audit line: issue number + `updated_at` at dispatch, anchor SHA, `origin/{pr_base}`
  SHA, head SHA, PR number, session id, models used, turns, usage, cost estimate, stop reason,
  `permission_denials`, hook/settings/plugin hashes, human-only-path check result, fixture
  check result. Mirrored into the PR body by the driver's identity with the log line's hash.

### 7.6 Stays human
Sprint scope and spec approval (plan-sprint), every `hitl_gate`, every merge to `pr_base`,
the release tag, the decision backlog, resolving #93/#122, minting and rotating tokens,
deciding `orchestration.*` policy per repo.

---

## 8. Decisions only the maintainer can make

1. **#93 and #122 on devcontainers.** The ledger promises them by 2026-10-17; the GitHub
   milestone says 2026-12-15. Step 3 and the loop identity's trust class both wait on them.
2. **Where the loop runs.** Three options, in the order the v2 security reviewer and the v3
   reviewer rank them: a dedicated Linux host or VM; a **WSL2 distro on the existing machine**
   with its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, its own machine-user `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, and no access to the
   maintainer's `gh` or GPG (§ 6.2 table, last row); the Windows host as-is (ranked last by
   every reviewer). *Author's recommendation, labelled as such:* do not build step 4 on the
   Windows host as-is; steps 1–2 pay on any host. The WSL2 option was not assessed by the v2
   reviewers and needs its own check of managed-settings behaviour before it is chosen.
3. **Wave granularity.** v3 asked the maintainer to "accept one wave of independent tasks per
   merge sitting as the throughput ceiling". That is today's cadence restated (§ 3.1): dependent
   tasks already wait on the human's merge, and independent ones are already merged one at a
   time. The wave model is no worse than today for chains and better for independent tasks, so
   there is nothing to accept. The real decision is whether to **re-open v1's sprint branch**
   to get N dependent tasks per sitting, at the review-granularity cost § 6.1's v4 note
   describes. If yes, the minimum protections are § 7.3's config restore from `origin/main`
   per session, a batch of two, per-task digests in the sprint PR, and a fresh-session review
   of the sprint PR as a whole.
4. **Which human authorizations become plan-time policy** (critic list, model, round cap, the
   independence marker) and what step 1's no-op handoff rule records on `main` — the content of
   the one WB-D.

---

## 9. Known gaps, unverified claims, and places the author may be biased

- **Never executed:** `claude -p` under `--permission-prompts none` with this plugin; a hook
  deny under `dontAsk`; `--setting-sources user` effect on project `CLAUDE.md`;
  `--max-budget-usd` behaviour on subscription auth; what a `-p` run reports at a usage limit
  (reported: error exit); whether `--autocompact 100k` degrades task quality.
- **Reported, not re-read by author:** claude-code-action security doc contents; Agent SDK
  auth statement; merge-queue plan availability; auto-mode availability; errors.md limit
  behaviour; the Flatt write-up of an issue-body injection exfiltrating a token from a Claude
  Action run (https://flatt.tech/research/posts/poisoning-claude-code-one-github-issue-to-break-the-supply-chain/).
- **Data limits:** transcript scan de-duplicated by `message.id`; one mirrored directory
  excluded; no reconciliation with Anthropic's accounting; "peak context" is input+cache
  tokens on the largest turn, not the API's own measure.
- **Possible over-correction:** the plan forbids any driver merge anywhere. A narrowly-scoped
  merge into a *throwaway integration branch whose config is never read by the next session*
  might be defensible; § 6.1's v4 note and § 8.3 now say so, but nobody has designed it.
- **Possible under-correction:** the no-op handoff rule (step 1) leaves `main`'s ledger one
  step stale during a review; a fresh machine with no `state.json` resumes from `main`. The
  author believes resume's GitHub-derived step covers it; not proven. v4 moves this into the
  WB-D rather than leaving it as a gap.
- **Fable preference:** the maintainer routes architect work to Fable (memory note). The plan
  keeps Fable to one judgment slot; a reviewer may think that is too little or too much.
- **Same-family revision:** v4 was produced by a second Fable 5.1 session acting as reviewer
  and then as editor. The § 6.3 corrections of fact were checked against primary sources; the
  § 6.3 items 11–17 are that session's judgement and could themselves be over-correction. The
  next review should be on another model family.
- **Note, not a decision (moved from v3's § 8.5):** the subscription-only constraint is the
  maintainer's stated requirement and the plan honours it. For the record, the constraint is
  what forces plain `-p` (hooks and plugins load) over `--bare`, and makes `--max-budget-usd` a
  proxy rather than a cap; an API key for the loop host alone would remove both. The plan does
  not ask for that; it records the cost.
- **The author did not read** bounty-infra's or infrastructure-core's threat models in full,
  nor devcontainers' `docs/threat_model.md` beyond grep hits. Neither did the v3 reviewer.

## 10. Appendix — artefacts and how to regenerate the numbers

Analysis scripts and the v1/v2/v3 drafts are copied beside this file in `docs/proposals/analysis/` (originals in the authoring session's scratchpad):
`C:\Users\SR116\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\c--Users-SR116-projects-glunk-works-claude-workbench\d2bb1d4a-393d-4799-95ed-47e30db7c48c\scratchpad\`
- `pr_analysis.py <repo>-prs.json …` — PR classification, open→merge timing, cadence.
  Input: `gh pr list -R <repo> --state all --limit 200 --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt,state,additions,deletions,changedFiles,files`.
- `usage_analysis.py <since>` — per-project/model/session usage from `~/.claude/projects`.
- `peak_ctx.py <since>` — per-session peak context; subagent totals.
- `daily_usage.py <days>` — daily envelope, de-duplicated; per-session medians by kind/model.
- `orchestrator-plan-v1.md`, `orchestrator-plan-v2.md`, `orchestrator-plan-v3.md` — the
  earlier drafts as reviewed. v3 is the document the § 6.3 review was run against.

The v3 reviewer re-ran `pr_analysis.py` (devcontainers, claude-workbench) and
`daily_usage.py 14` on 2026-10-04 and reproduced § 3 within one PR; the relay-PR count used
`'review next' in title.lower()` over the same 200-PR pull.

Memory note written by the authoring session: `token-spend-data-lives-in-transcript-usage-fields.md`
(where usage data lives; the mirrored directory).

The eight subagent reports and the authoring session's transcript are exported under
`docs/proposals/analysis/session-export/` (git-ignored). Its README says **do not read unless
required**: it is context for the maintainer, not review input. § 6 condenses the reports.
The v3 review session's own transcript is not exported.
