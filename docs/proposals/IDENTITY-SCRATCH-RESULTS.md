# Identity model proof on wb-ruleset-scratch (#376)

Proof cases a-k from #376, run against `glunk-works/wb-ruleset-scratch` with the three
WB-D24 Apps (`glunk-dev`, `glunk-review`, `glunk-admin`) and the rulesets saved in
[docs/identity/scratch-rulesets/](../identity/scratch-rulesets/). Five sessions. Raw API output
follows the summary, in the order it was run. Each entry names the identity it ran as.

## Summary

| Case | Claim | Result |
|---|---|---|
| a | dev App can't self-approve or self-merge | **Pass.** Approve: 422 "Can not approve your own pull request". Merge: 405 "Waiting on code owner review". |
| b | a push dismisses an approval | **Pass.** After a dev-App push the approval reads `DISMISSED`, `reviewDecision: REVIEW_REQUIRED` (PR 1, PR 8). |
| c | auto-merge fires after the approval | **Pass with one stall, filed as #432.** Fired 16s (PR 4), 10s (PR 7) and 4s (PR 8) after the approval. PR 1 read `CLEAN`/`APPROVED` with auto-merge armed for 3+ minutes and never fired; a direct dev-App merge pinned to the head then succeeded. PR 8 repeated PR 1's exact sequence and fired. Not a clean run: PR 4's head moved after arming (JaredGroves-603's update-branch merge, 962e566), and auto-merge still fired. So `expectedHeadOid` is apparently checked only when auto-merge is enabled, and the approval dismissal is the guard after that. That account then approved its own push and the PR merged under `require_last_push_approval`, so a base-merge apparently isn't a "reviewable push". Both are resolved in session 3 (items 1 and 2). |
| d | a fake status is ignored, a real one counts | **Pass, for a user-posted fake.** With no status: "Required status check is expected". With a `success` posted by a user: "was not set by the expected GitHub app". The Actions-posted status satisfied the rule on every merged PR. Caveat: the combined-status API reads `success` after the fake, so only the ruleset, not that read, tells the sources apart. A fake from another App is refused too (session 3, item 6). The pin is to GitHub Actions itself, so any workflow run counts. The dev App can edit scripts CI runs (not workflow files), so a required check is no integrity barrier against it; the code-owner review is. |
| e | the second code owner's approval merges | **Pass.** JaredGroves-603's approval made PR 5 `CLEAN` and it merged. Precondition: the owner needs write access. Before the invite, the merge message named only Seuss27; after it, "JaredGroves-603 and/or Seuss27". So each repo needs that second login with write, which makes it a full approve, merge and push credential (session 1's void case f is that credential being used by an agent). An owner approving their own content push is blocked (session 3, item 1). |
| f | the reviewer App's COMMENT satisfies a reviewer-ID gate; its approval doesn't count; it can't merge or push | **Partial (re-run).** COMMENT recorded as `glunk-review[bot]`, id 339841158, type Bot. Its APPROVE is accepted but changes nothing (`REVIEW_REQUIRED`, merge still "Waiting on code owner review"). Merge: 403. Push: 403. The scratch repo has no reviewer-ID CI gate, so what is proven is the stable attribution a gate would key on, not the gate itself. "Doesn't count" was measured with CODEOWNERS covering `*`; an uncovered path and the App's other `pull_requests: write` powers were tested in session 3 (items 3 and 4). The session-1 attempt is void (see its note). |
| g | revoking a token kills it | **Consistent, not conclusive.** After `wow-admin --revoke` the same token gets 401 "Bad credentials". No success with that same token just before the revoke is recorded; whether the earlier admin-token calls in case e used the same token is not recorded, and an expired token also gets 401. The end-to-end run is in session 3 (item 5). |
| h | no workflow or release-tag writes | **Pass after a scratch-config fix, filed as #433 for the other repos.** Workflow file: 403. Moving or deleting a `v*` tag: refused by the ruleset. Creating a `v*` tag or a release succeeded until a `creation` rule was added to `wb-tags` (as claude-workbench's `release-tag-creation` already has), after which both were refused: the tag with 422 "Reference update failed", the release with "Cannot create ref due to creations being restricted". Editing, deleting or adding assets to an existing release is not blocked (session 3, item 7); with GitHub's immutable-releases setting on, asset changes are refused and notes edits and release deletion remain (session 4, item 9). |
| i | the App token reaches only its installation | **Pass.** `installation/repositories` lists only the scratch repo. `.permissions` on the repo reads all `false` for an App token, so it is not a reach signal. The installation covers only this repo, so this didn't separate `mint.sh`'s `repositories` narrowing from installation scope; session 3 (item 8) did. |
| j | update-branch works for the dev App | **Pass.** Works with `allow_update_branch: false` (that setting only hides the UI button). 422 "no new commits" when main hasn't moved. |
| k | auto-merge on an already-mergeable PR | **Refused by GitHub, handled by `gh`.** The raw mutation fails with "Pull request is in clean status", as documented. `gh pr merge --auto` merges immediately in that state (`isImmediatelyMergeable`), so `ship` never sees the refusal. Noted on #386, whose "not armed" path won't occur. |

Also observed: the dev App gets 403 on the rule-suites API, so it cannot read why a rule
blocked; the merge error text is the only explanation it sees.

## Session 3 (#435): the questions #376 left open

Eight items, run on 2026-10-09 against the same repo and Apps. The maintainer acted as the
code-owner approver (Seuss27) and minted the admin tokens; JaredGroves-603 was not needed.
None of items 1-3 weakens the merge gate, so no blocking issue was filed.

| Item | Question | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does last-push approval apply to a code owner's own push, and to a base merge? | **Owner's content push: blocked.** PR 11: Seuss27 pushed a content commit and approved it; the dev App's merge was refused with "New changes require approval from someone other than Seuss27 because they were the last pusher." **Dev App's merge push with an extra change: approval dismissed.** PR 12: a merge commit with parents (PR head, `main`) and one extra file moved the approval to `DISMISSED` and `reviewDecision` to `REVIEW_REQUIRED`; the merge was refused ("Waiting on code owner review"). **Approver's own pure base merge: not a reviewable push.** On PR 12 Seuss27 used Update branch, then approved the result, and the PR read `CLEAN`, as on PR 4 with the other owner. Not tested: an approver pushing a merge commit that carries extra changes. |
| 2 | After auto-merge is armed, is anything but the approval a guard? | **No.** PR 13: auto-merge armed pinned to commit A (68fb676), then the dev App (a writer) pushed commit B (7748a12). The PR stayed armed and `BLOCKED` on `REVIEW_REQUIRED`; after Seuss27 approved B it merged at B, not A. The pin is checked only when auto-merge is enabled. |
| 3 | Is the reviewer App's approval ignored on a path no CODEOWNERS entry covers? | **Yes.** CODEOWNERS was narrowed to `/owned/` (PR 9). On PR 10 (path `free/`), the reviewer App's APPROVE was recorded as `APPROVED` but `reviewDecision` stayed `REVIEW_REQUIRED` and the merge was refused. After Seuss27's approval the same PR read `CLEAN`, consistent with the count rule wanting a reviewer with write access, which the bot is not. |
| 4 | What else can the reviewer App do with `pull_requests: write`? | **It can:** dismiss a human approval (PR 12 went from `CLEAN` to `BLOCKED`), edit a PR's title, body and base, and close and reopen a PR. **It cannot:** disable auto-merge ("Resource not accessible by integration"). None is a merge path. Dismissal can stall a merge and the edits can mislead a human reader, so they are accepted residuals in WB-D24. |
| 5 | Revoke, end to end | **Pass.** An admin token read the rulesets, `wow-admin --revoke` reported success, and the same token then got 401 "Bad credentials" on two calls, all inside its hour. The first attempt did not keep a copy of the token and could not show the 401; the run listed here is the second. |
| 6 | A fake status from another App | **Refused.** With `glunk-dev` temporarily granted `statuses: write`, it posted `scratch/status=success` on PR 14's head (creator `glunk-dev[bot]`, type Bot). The merge was refused with `Required status check "scratch/status" was not set by the expected GitHub app.` The combined-status API reads `success` regardless. |
| 7 | Release writes besides tag creation | **Not blocked.** As the dev App: creating a draft release for a new `v*` tag, editing an existing `v*` release, uploading an asset to it, deleting the asset and deleting the release all succeeded (the tag stayed). Publishing the draft was refused by the creation rule (422, "Cannot create ref due to creations being restricted"). So the dev App can rewrite or remove release notes and assets of a published release. |
| 8 | Does `repositories` narrowing hold with two repos installed? | **Yes for `glunk-dev` and `glunk-admin`.** With `wb-ruleset-scratch-2` added to the installations, a token minted for one repo lists only that repo in `installation/repositories`, writes to the other get 404 or 403, and a request for a repo outside the installation is refused with 422 at mint. The reviewer App's narrowing was not tested separately there; session 4 (item 12) did. Also found: the admin token created `wb-ruleset-scratch-2` through `POST /orgs/glunk-works/repos`, although it is scoped to one repo and could not read the repo it made. |

Follow-ups this surfaced, none a merge-gate weakening:

- WB-D24's accepted residuals gain the reviewer App's powers (item 4) and an admin token's
  ability to create org repositories (item 8).
- The dev App's release writes (item 7) are an integrity gap for published release assets
  and notes. Filed separately for a restrict-or-accept decision.

## Configuration changes made during session 3

- **CODEOWNERS** on the scratch repo was narrowed from `*` to `/owned/ @Seuss27
  @JaredGroves-603` (PR 9), so that item 3 had a path no entry covers.
- **`wb-ruleset-scratch-2`** was created (private) by an admin token, and added to the
  installations of `glunk-dev`, `glunk-admin` and `glunk-review`.
- **`glunk-dev`** was granted `statuses: write` for item 6 only, then reverted by the
  maintainer.

## Calls made outside the recording helper

The session-3 helper (`rec.sh`) records the identity and the raw output, and refuses an empty
token or one that cannot list its installation repositories. These steps ran without it:

- `mint.sh` for the dev App with `statuses=write`, before the grant: HTTP 422, "The level of
  access for permissions requested are not granted to this installation."
- Item 8 mints (`mint.sh`, dev App, installation 169399440): `--repos wb-ruleset-scratch`
  and `--repos wb-ruleset-scratch-2` minted; `--repos claude-workbench` failed with HTTP 422,
  "There is at least one repository that does not exist or is not accessible to the parent
  installation."
- The reviewer App's first title edit was refused by the helper because its reach probe got a
  502; the retry is recorded below.
- Item 1's Update branch click on PR 12 was the maintainer's, in the browser; its effect is
  read back below (commit a5cd01f, author "Jared Groves", parents `ee6cb40` and `57407c8`).
- The two post-revoke calls in item 5 bypass the helper's reach guard on purpose, because the
  token is expected to fail it; they are labelled in the output.
- Reading "repo 1 is public" explains why a token narrowed to repo 2 could read repo 1's
  README; the write to repo 1 from that token returned 403.

## Configuration changes made during the proof

- **glunk-review** was installed with `pull_requests: write` only, as #372 specified, but `wow-review-mint` (#374) requests `contents`, `checks` and `statuses` read as
  well, so no reviewer token could be minted. The App and its installation now hold
  `contents: read, checks: read, statuses: read, pull_requests: write`. WB-D24 is amended to
  match.
- **glunk-admin** gained `contents: write` and `pull_requests: write` beside the specified
  administration, workflows, environments and actions, because `wow-admin`'s default mint
  requests them. `--perms` replaces that default set for one mint, either way.
- **JaredGroves-603** was invited to the scratch repo with write access (case e).
- **wb-tags** gained a `creation` rule (case h), made through an admin-mode token. The ruleset's
  history records the actor as Bot 339842227, `glunk-admin[bot]`.

## Side effects of the void session-1 case f

Four calls labelled "review App token" ran as JaredGroves-603, a human code owner, not the
reviewer App. They approved and merged PR 6 (`merged_by` JaredGroves-603) and pushed
`f-reviewer.txt` to `case-f` (commit bad72e8, authored by JaredGroves-603). Only the scratch
repo was touched.

How the token got there is not established. The likeliest path: the session-1 helper got its
"refuse an empty token" guard in an edit last saved about 15 seconds after the last case-f call, so the reviewer token
probably came out empty. `gh` treats an empty `GH_TOKEN` as unset and falls back to the
host's stored login. That fail-open is filed as #436. The session-2 helper also refuses any
token that cannot list its installation's repositories, which a user token cannot.

## Session 4 (#439): release writes, an approver's merge commit, the reviewer App's narrowing

Run on 2026-10-09 against the same repo and Apps. The maintainer enabled the setting, added a
temporary bypass, pushed as the approver and minted tokens; I probed as `glunk-dev` and
`glunk-review`.

| Item | Question | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | Does GitHub's immutable-releases setting restrict the dev App's release writes? | **Partly.** With the setting on, a published release reads `immutable: true`. As the dev App, uploading an asset (422 "Cannot upload assets to an immutable release"), deleting an asset (422) and deleting the tag (422, the `wb-tags` ruleset) are refused. **Still allowed:** editing the release's notes and title, and deleting the release itself. Deleting it leaves the tag in place, and the tag name cannot be reused: publishing a draft for it is refused (422 "tag_name was used by an immutable release"). Creating a draft release is still allowed; publishing one for a new tag is refused by the creation rule. Not shown: whether a release edit can retarget the tag, because `main` had not moved and the edit was a no-op. The setting applies only to releases published after it is on. |
| 10 | Does `release.yml`'s shape still publish? | **Yes.** `gh release create v0.0.2 --target <sha> --title --notes-file`, one call and no assets, published as immutable on the scratch repo. `release.yml` attaches no assets, so there is nothing to add after publishing. |
| 11 | An approver pushes a merge commit that carries an extra change | **Blocked.** PR 15: the dev App opened it with one commit and Seuss27 approved. Seuss27 then pushed a merge commit (parents: the PR head and a side branch) that added `free/extra-in-merge.txt`, present in neither parent. The approval moved to `DISMISSED`, `reviewDecision` to `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, and the dev App's merge was refused ("New changes require approval from someone other than the last pusher"). Seuss27's second approval was recorded as `APPROVED` on the new head but did not count: the merge was refused again, now naming Seuss27 as the last pusher. After an approver's push the other code owner has to approve. |
| 12 | Does the reviewer App's `repositories` narrowing hold with two repos installed? | **Yes.** `wb-ruleset-scratch-3` (private) was added to the `glunk-review` installation. A token minted for `wb-ruleset-scratch` lists only that repo, cannot read `-3` (404) and can edit a PR on its own repo. A token minted for `-3` lists only `-3`, reads it, and is refused (403) when it edits a PR on `wb-ruleset-scratch`. The scratch repo is public, so reading it needs no grant. The write probe on `-3` was not run: that repo is empty and has no PR. |

Follow-ups: WB-D24's release residual narrows to notes, title and deletion of a release
(the code, the tag and any assets stay), and immutable releases joins the per-repo cutover
settings.

## Configuration changes made during session 4

- **Immutable releases** enabled on `wb-ruleset-scratch` by the maintainer. `v0.0.1` (one asset)
  stays published as an immutable release; `v0.0.2` was deleted in item 9 and its tag remains.
- **`wb-tags`** had a Repository admin bypass added by the maintainer, so Seuss27 could publish
  the two releases, and removed again before any dev-App probe.
- **`wb-ruleset-scratch-3`** created (private, empty) by the maintainer and added to the
  `glunk-review` installation. It stays until the maintainer deletes it.
- PR 14's title was edited by the reviewer token and restored to `item6`. PR 15 and its two
  branches were closed and deleted. `main` is unchanged at `57407c8`.

## Calls made outside the recording helper (session 4)

The helper refuses an empty token or one that cannot list its installation repositories.
These steps did not go through it:

- Publishing `v0.0.1` (draft, asset, publish) and `v0.0.2` (one `gh release create`) as the
  Seuss27 user token, with the maintainer's bypass in place. `v0.0.1` read `immutable: true`
  from the publish response.
- The maintainer's own steps: enabling the setting, the bypass, Seuss27's approvals and the
  merge-commit push on PR 15 (its effect is read back in item 11), creating the repo and adding
  it to the installation.
- The two minting scripts that ran `mint.sh` (dev App) and `wow-review-mint` (both repos).
- Reading `wb-ruleset-scratch` rulesets and PR state as Seuss27 while designing the case.

## Session 5 (#377): the same cases under a 603-Identity org ruleset

Run on 2026-10-09 against a private scratch repo in 603-Identity, with that org's own three Apps
(`603id-dev`, `603id-review`, `603id-admin`), one org ruleset and two repo rulesets. The ruleset
bodies are the saved ones in [docs/identity/scratch-rulesets/](../identity/scratch-rulesets/); the
org copy adds a `repository_name` include list naming only the scratch repo.

The maintainer registered and installed the Apps, and approved the PRs in the browser. I created
the repo and rulesets, minted the dev and reviewer tokens, and ran the probes through a recording
helper that refuses a token which cannot list its installation repositories (App tokens) or whose
login cannot be read (user tokens).

**No second code owner.** CODEOWNERS names one account, JaredGroves-603. The maintainer chose not
to buy a seat for a second owner that only an emergency would use, so case e (the second owner's
approval merges) was **not run**. Item 16 replaces it, and item 18 checks that the org rule can't
be weakened from inside a container. WB-D24's second-owner text needs a 603 amendment (follow-up
below).

| Item | Question | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 13 | (a) The dev App can't self-approve or self-merge under the org rule | **Pass.** PR 1: approve 422 "Can not approve your own pull request"; merge 405 "Waiting on code owner review from JaredGroves-603". |
| 14 | (b) A push dismisses the approval | **Pass.** PR 3: after the dev App pushed, GraphQL reads the review `DISMISSED` and `reviewDecision` `REVIEW_REQUIRED`. The REST review list still read `APPROVED` for the first seconds, so the dismissal is asynchronous. |
| 15 | (c) Auto-merge fires after the approval | **Pass, late both times.** Armed by the dev App, pinned to the head. PR 1: approved 14:11:22Z, merged 14:13:23Z (2 min 1 s), `clean` and unfired for the first minute. PR 4: approved 14:16:54Z and nothing fired; the maintainer deliberately re-approved at 14:17:19Z and it merged 14:17:37Z (18 s after the second approval, 43 s after the first). `merged_by` is the dev App both times, the approval appears only in the review list. A re-approval is something that happened before the merge, not a proven cause. With the stall in #432 that is three of four first approvals that didn't fire promptly. |
| 16 | (e, replaced) A maintainer-authored PR can't be approved or merged by its author | **Pass.** PR 2: self-approve 422 "Can not approve your own pull request"; merge 405 "New changes require approval from someone other than the last pusher" and the missing `scratch/status`. Without a second owner, a human-authored change in a 603 repo needs the maintainer to route it through the dev App, or to suspend the org ruleset in the browser. |
| 17 | Do App tokens read the org-sourced rules? | **Yes.** Dev and reviewer App tokens: `rules/branches/main` lists the `pull_request`, `deletion` and `non_fast_forward` rules with source "Organization" beside the repo's `required_status_checks`, and `repos/R/rulesets` lists the org ruleset with `source_type: Organization`. The org-path read of the ruleset (`orgs/603-Identity/rulesets/<id>`) is 403 for the dev App. |
| 18 | Can a repo-scoped admin token weaken the org approval rule? | **No.** With `administration=write` scoped to the scratch repo: org path read 403 and edit 403 "Resource not accessible by integration"; the repo path reads it (`source_type` Organization, `active`) but an edit returns 404. It still read `active` afterwards. Contrast: the same token renamed the repo's own `wb-checks` and the name was restored; all three rulesets read back unchanged. So admin mode in a container can weaken repo rulesets but not the org approval rule. |
| 19 | #443/#444: the host config is keyed by role (`dev`, `review`, `admin`) | **Pass.** Under `~/.config/603id-identity` the reviewer and dev tokens minted and listed only the scratch repo; the admin App minted with the passphrase (`contents=read`, then `administration=write`), listed only the scratch repo, and a revoked token got 401 "Bad credentials" (before and after output pasted by the maintainer, not in the raw log). The same checks passed earlier today on the glunk-works host config after its two keys were renamed. |

Follow-ups:
- WB-D24's second-owner text now carries a 603-Identity amendment (one code owner, break glass
  in the browser, human-wanted changes routed through the dev App), made in this PR.
- The item 15 timings are on #432: a second approval was followed by the merge in 18 s.

## Configuration changes made during session 5

- **Repo** `603-Identity/identity-ruleset-scratch`: private, auto-merge on, delete branch on merge on.
  `main` holds `.github/CODEOWNERS` (`* @JaredGroves-603`) and the `scratch-status` workflow. PRs 1
  and 4 merged (`main` is at `50abe9a`); PRs 2 and 3 were closed unmerged. All probe branches are
  deleted. The repo stays until the maintainer deletes it.
- **Rulesets**: org `wb-approval` (include list: this repo only, no bypass), repo `wb-checks` and
  `wb-tags`. `wb-checks` was renamed and restored in item 18.
- **Tokens**: reviewer, dev and two admin tokens minted. Both admin tokens were revoked and each
  got 401 afterwards; the dev and reviewer tokens expire within the hour.

## Calls made outside the recording helper (session 5)

- Creating the repo, its two files and the three rulesets, as JaredGroves-603 through a
  per-process token.
- The Apps' registration and installation, the host config, the passphrase mints and revokes, and
  all review approvals (PR 1, PR 3, PR 4 twice), which were the maintainer's.
- Reading the org's installation list to fill in the host config.

#### f: VOID -- the four "review App token" calls above ran as JaredGroves-603, not glunk-review[bot]

Every call labelled `review App token` returned `user.login` JaredGroves-603 (id 281693088), a
human code owner with write access. So these results show what that user account can do, not
what the reviewer App can do. They also made real changes: an APPROVE on PR 6, the merge of PR 6
(e228b24), and a commit pushed to case-f (bad72e8). On 2026-10-09 the reviewer App, both as
configured and as installed, held only `metadata: read, pull_requests: write`, while
`wow-review-mint` asks for `contents=read,checks=read,statuses=read,pull_requests=write`.
A mint therefore cannot have produced the token on file. Case f is re-run after the
reviewer App is fixed.

## Session 6 (#380): the plugin's identity reads under a dev App token

Run on 2026-10-09 against `603-Identity/identity-ruleset-scratch`, with tokens minted from the
dev App by `scripts/identity/mint.sh` (host config, key `dev.pem`), tokens kept in the session
scratchpad, never printed. Read-only except one `git push --dry-run`, which creates nothing
(confirmed: no `wow-380-probe` branch afterwards). Not a recorded-helper run: results below are
what the commands returned, not a raw log.

| Probe (token) | Result |
|---|---|
| `gh api user` (`contents:write, pull_requests:write`) | **403** "Resource not accessible by integration". The skills' bare `gh api user` fails under a dev App token; this is the first measurement of it. |
| `gh api repos/R --jq .permissions` (same) | `{"admin":false,"maintain":false,"pull":false,"push":false,"triage":false}`, exit 0. Confirms case i. |
| `installation/repositories` then `gh-identity.sh reach R` | `reached` (one repo listed). |
| `token-check.sh verify any R …` | `installation`. |
| milestones, rulesets, `rules/branches/main` (same token) | readable: `0` milestones, rulesets `wb-approval, wb-checks, wb-tags`, rule types `pull_request, deletion, non_fast_forward, required_status_checks`. |
| open issues, token with `contents`+`pull_requests` only | **403**. `reached` is not read access to Issues. |
| open issues, token with `issues: read, contents: read` | `0`, exit 0. The backlog reads work when the token carries `issues`. |
| `git push --dry-run` of a new branch, `contents: write` | succeeds (`[new branch] HEAD -> wow-380-probe`), nothing created. |
| same, `contents: read` | **403** "Write access to repository not granted", rc 128. |
| skill command sequences as the App, in a clone with a scratch `.ai/project.yml` | `schema-complete.sh` `complete`; `cursor-sync-pr.sh` `none`; `rulesets` and `rules/branches/main` readable (`pull_request, deletion, non_fast_forward`); prune's `gh pr list --state merged` works; `plan-gather.sh unmilestoned/milestones` exit 0; resume's review-step first link (`gh api user`) fails rc 1, so nothing derives. |
| retro/archive-sprint style writes: `gh issue create`, `comment`, `close` (`issues: write`) | all succeed. The created issue's `user` is `603id-dev[bot]`, id 340163647, `author_association` **NONE** (viewer-relative, as WB-D24 says). |
| ship end to end: branch, commit, `git push`, `gh pr create` (`contents`+`pull_requests` write) | all succeed. The PR's `user` is the same `[bot]` login and id; `mergeable_state` `blocked` (approval gate). The probe PR (#6) was closed and its branch deleted. ship's own preflight (`.permissions.push`) reads `false` here and would have stopped it. |
| `gh-identity.sh classify` / `role` / `author` with that `{login, id}` against an `identities` map declaring it as `dev_app` | `app` / `dev_app` / `untrusted`. So an App's `{login, id}` **is** obtainable: from the `user` of a write response, after a first write. |

Consequences recorded in `conventions.md` § *Acting identity and reach*: the `reached` probe is
read reach only; a backlog read needs a token minted with `issues`; `git push --dry-run` is a
working write probe for the credential `git` holds but does not say which App holds it; an App's
`{login, id}` comes from the `user` of a write response, so it can report who acted after the
first write but cannot gate it, which is why ship's push preflight still stops in App mode.
Not measured: the skills run as interactive Claude Code sessions (the command sequences above
were run by hand in a scratch clone), and resume's review-step derivation, which needs a user
login.
