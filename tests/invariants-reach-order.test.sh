# Fixture tests for scripts/invariants-check.sh's check 3: the reach check precedes the
# ruleset call in /resume.
#
# The check's ordering half was a silent no-op for its whole life: it looked for the
# ruleset call as `gh api repos/{repo}/rules/branches`, but every real call is written
# `gh api --paginate repos/{repo}/rules/branches/...`, so the pattern never matched, the
# `[ -n "$ruleset" ]` guard swallowed the empty result, and a wrong ordering could not
# fail. No fixture would have gone red against that bug, because the real file's order is
# already right -- a test that only feeds the real tree is a control that yields the same
# answer with or without the fix. So each case here mutates a COPY of the real /resume
# skill into a wrong order (or removes the call) and asserts the check fires. Run against
# the pre-#162 script, the `paginate`, `twoflags`, `missing` and `not_a_call` cases fail;
# `noflag` passes there too (the old pattern matched it) and stays as a guard against a
# later fix over-tightening the pattern. The real-tree case is a deliberate control.
# See issue #162.
#
# Only check 3's own messages are asserted, never the script's overall exit: the other
# checks (yq-backed ones, the two prune-block copies) run over the same copied tree and
# are not this suite's business.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh. No jq, no yq, no python.
