# #436 (WB-D24): every consumer of a minted token fails closed on an empty, expired, user or
# wrong-App token before acting, so `gh` never falls back to a human's stored login.
#
# Needs yq (mikefarah v4) for `verify` with an actor; skips those cases, loudly, when absent.
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh.
