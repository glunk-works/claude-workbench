# Fixture tests for plugins/way-of-working/bin/cursor-drift.sh.

# Each fixture is a throwaway git repo built in a tempdir so the assertions run
# against real git plumbing, not a mock of it -- the bug class this guards
# against (v0.3.0 SHA equality, v0.4.0 the commit-range form) was a wrong
# argument to real git commands, which only a real repo can catch. See issue #21
# and docs/decisions.md WB-D7.
#
# Permitted toolset: git, POSIX sh. No jq, no yq, no python. Plus bash, optionally,
# for the one shell-portability fixture -- skipped, loudly, where bash is absent or
# too old to know `lastpipe`; the script under test itself never needs it.

# (A) while its own PR is still open; that branch squash-merges first (A ->
# A', a new commit object A never becomes an ancestor of); only THEN does a
# separate cursor-sync commit (B, parent A') get its own squash-merge (B ->
# B'). At that point `git rev-list --count A..B'` is 2, not 1 -- the exact
# count the old carve-out required and did not get.

# the CAPABILITY, not the binary: bash < 4.2 (stock macOS ships 3.2) rejects
# the option with exit 2 and never runs the script, which would read as a
# spurious FAIL pointing at the script. Skip, loudly, on such a machine.
