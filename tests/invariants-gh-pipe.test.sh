# Fixture tests for scripts/invariants-check.sh's check 11: `gh` output is never piped
# straight into a bin/ predicate script (#243).
#
# A test that only feeds the real tree is a control that answers the same with or without
# the check (the real skills already capture first), so each case here mutates a COPY of
# the real pr-checks skill to reintroduce a pipe and asserts the check fires. The `safe_*`
# cases are the other half: the captured form the skill actually uses, and `||`, must NOT
# fire, or the check would reject the very shape it exists to protect.
#
# Only check 11's own message is asserted, never the script's overall exit: the other
# checks run over the same copied tree and are not this suite's business.
#
# Permitted toolset: POSIX sh. No jq, no yq, no python.
