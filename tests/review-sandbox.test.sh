# Fixture tests for plugins/way-of-working/bin/review-sandbox.sh (issue #113).
#
# Real throwaway git repos drive the git-plumbing assertions (a "remote"/"origin" plus
# a "workspace" checkout, in review-base-anchor.test.sh's style) -- the bug class this
# guards against is real git behavior under a specific ref/config shape, which only
# real git plumbing can catch. `gh` is the one dependency stubbed, through
# $REVIEW_SANDBOX_GH -- `trust` AND `make` both call it now (`make` re-verifies trust
# itself before building anything; `run`/`destroy` never call `gh` at all).
#
# core.autocrlf: pinned to false on every repo before its first commit or clone, same
# reasoning as review-base-anchor.test.sh's header -- a repo that inherits this
# machine's system-wide core.autocrlf=true converts LF to CRLF on checkout, which would
# make a byte-for-byte content assertion below false-positive.
#
# THE MUTATION THAT MUST TURN THIS SUITE RED: in review-sandbox.sh's `make`, replace
# the `git init --template=<empty> <sbx> && git -C <sbx> fetch --no-tags <workspace>
# refs/review-sandbox/<N>` pair with `git worktree add <sbx> <sha>` against the
# workspace directly, AND drop (or stub out) the `FETCHED` sha-pin check right after
# it -- a plain worktree mutation alone STOPs at that check first (`git -C "$SBX"
# rev-parse FETCH_HEAD` fails: a worktree has no per-worktree FETCH_HEAD of its own).
# That does NOT abort cleanly at "make: succeeds" -- `assert_eq` just prints FAIL and
# continues, so "make: succeeds" and "sandbox is checked out" both print FAIL, and the
# suite only aborts a few lines later, under this file's OWN `set -e`, at the first
# unguarded git command against the (now-garbage) $sbx value
# (`head_sha="$(git -C "$sbx" rev-parse HEAD)"`) -- so it still reads as a suite
# failure, but not the RIGHT one, and not for the reason it looks like -- confirmed by
# running the literal, partial mutation. With both changes made, run this suite
# unmodified afterward -- the "no origin remote" and "no local branches copied"
# fixtures below must both fail, because a worktree shares the workspace's own `.git`
# outright (nothing to leak -- it has direct access) rather than merely risking a leak
# through a clone-shaped copy. (The FETCH_HEAD/reflog fixtures do NOT catch this
# mutation: in a worktree, `$sbx/.git` is a FILE, not a directory, so
# `[ -f "$sbx/.git/FETCH_HEAD" ]` and `[ -f "$sbx/.git/logs/HEAD" ]` are both false
# and those checks read "ok" either way -- confirmed by running the full mutation.
# They still guard the CURRENT design's own FETCH_HEAD leak, just not this specific
# mutation.)
#
# Permitted toolset: git, POSIX sh, real (or stubbed, per fixture) `gh` on PATH,
# `sha256sum`/`shasum` (to assert on the marker's hash, same as the script itself
# needs). No jq, no python.

# own `-c core.hooksPath="$EMPTY_TEMPLATE"` overrides regardless of what the ENV VAR
# points `make` at protecting against -- proving nothing about GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/
# NOSYSTEM at all; (2) the canary script's path was written with a raw MSYS-style
# path (`printf '%s'`), which native git.exe does not translate inside a CONFIG FILE
# value the way it translates an argv path -- the hook never would have fired even
# unprotected. Fixed shape: a global `filter.canary.smudge` (a key none of make's own
# `-c filter.lfs.*=` overrides touch, since those name `filter.lfs`, not
# `filter.canary`) triggered by a `.gitattributes` in the PR's own commit, with the

# away from the inherited pipe -- back when `run` piped its output through `head -c`
# directly, a lingering grandchild holding that pipe open made `run` itself BLOCK
# until the probe's full 30s sleep finished naturally, so by the time this fixture
# got to check, the probe had already exited on its own and "ok" was true for the
# wrong reason (`run` never raced the kill at all). `run` no longer pipes its output
# (see review-sandbox.sh's own comment on that fix), so it should now return almost
# immediately regardless of the probe -- but the probe still redirects its own stdio
# here anyway, so this fixture does not depend on that other fix to mean what it says.

# Two things were wrong with an earlier version of this fixture, found by mutation
# (deleting the `case "$sbx_canon" in "$root_canon"/*) ... *) return 1 ;; esac`
# boundary check in `require_in_root` left the suite green): (1) `run`/`destroy` were
# called with NO `$REVIEW_SANDBOX_ROOT` set, so `sandbox_root()` fell back to the
# UNRELATED default root, and the refusal that fired came from `canon` failing on
# THAT nonexistent root, never reaching the boundary check at all; (2) the escape
# target's own leaf name didn't match any real marker, so even with a root set the
# refusal could come from the marker lookup instead. Both bugs let the fixture pass
# for the wrong reason regardless of whether the boundary check itself worked.
#
# Fixed shape: reuse the SAME root a real sandbox was just built in (so a REAL
# "7.marker" exists there), and escape to a directory OUTSIDE that root whose OWN
# leaf name is also "7" -- so if the boundary check is the only thing standing in the
# way (which is exactly what this fixture must prove), `require_in_root`'s marker
# lookup (`$root_canon/$n.marker`, keyed only by leaf name) would otherwise happily
# find the real sandbox's own marker and let it through. This is the shape that
# actually goes red under the mutation above; the previous one did not.
